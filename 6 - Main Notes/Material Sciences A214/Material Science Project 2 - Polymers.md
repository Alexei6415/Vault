# Material Science Project 2 - Polymers

Polymers are incredibly versatile and find applications in both medicine and Formula 1, albeit in very different ways. Here's a breakdown:

### **Uses of Polymers in Medicine**

1. **Implants and Prosthetics**: Polymers like polyethylene and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) are used in joint replacements, spinal implants, and prosthetic devices due to their biocompatibility and durability.
    
2. **Drug Delivery Systems**: Biodegradable polymers are employed to create controlled-release drug delivery systems, ensuring medication is released over time.
    
3. **Surgical Sutures**: Polymers like polyglycolic acid are used for absorbable sutures.
    
4. **Medical Devices**: Catheters, stents, and heart valves often incorporate polymers for their flexibility and resistance to wear.
    
5. **Tissue Engineering**: Polymers serve as scaffolds to support cell growth and tissue regeneration.

# Possible Questions
Scenario: You are a 2nd year engineering student who is working as an intern to a Biomedical company called "MightyMed" , you have been assigned to shadow a surgeon who's main goal is to help find solutions to patients who have suffered great loss or who require prosthetics. You, as a student with great passion for material science know that polymers could be a great material to help these patients. Answer the following questions in full paragraphs and UK English.
1. A patient is in need of a skin graft, however they are unable to use their own skin for a graft, give 3 reasons why Polymers will be a good substitute for skin and which 2 materials do you believe would be good alternatives.(5)
	1. Answer - polymers can be very stretchy which is a vital characteristic for skin. Polymers are also not very chemically reactive which is very useful when used in the body as it wont react with the polymer, etc 2 materials are Polyurethane, PDMS(polydimethylsiloxane), silicone rubber.
2. Your next patient is in need of a hip replacement. why would a polymer be a good material for a hip replacement, do you want the same similarities as a polymer used as a skin graft? Explain the best properties of polymers and how we can change a polymer to better suit a hip replacement?(5)
	1. Yes it is, chemically unreactive, can be very durable, have very low friction coefficients - good in hip joints- we can change a polymer to have these properties by increasing crystallinity and blah blah blah
	2. In total hip replacement, ==polymers, particularly ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), are commonly used for the liner or bearing surface of the socket, aiming to reduce friction and wear==. 


3. Polymers have a diverse range of  properties, given the information below graph a Temperature vs Logarithm Relaxation Modulus, of the 2 materials, after explain why there is a difference in the 2 graphs (5)
	1. graph drawn ( will draw at some point) and the reason for big difference is one is a crystalline material and one is amourphous, 5 marks for graph, 2 for explanation, Tg and Tm must be labelled 
4. What are  3 ways to improve strength in a polymer? and what other effects do these methods have on the polymer?(5)
	2. Degree of Crystallinity,Predeformation by Drawing,Heat-Treating
	3.  Drawing
		Stretches the polymer prior to use, 
		Aligns chains in the stretching direction
		###### Results of drawing
		- Increases Elastic modulus in the stretching direction.
		- Increases the tensile strength in the stretching direction
		- decreases ductility ( %EL )
		##### Annealing After Drawing
		- Decreases Alignment
		- reverses drawing affect
		- Increases degree of crystallinity for Undrawn Polymers
		- Contrasts to effect of cold working metals

# Questions 
Scenario : You are a second year Engineering student who has a vast knowledge of material science and specifically polymers. You have landed an internship with a biomedical engineer who works at the local hospital MightyMed. Your job as an intern is to help the biomedical engineers think of ways to help patients who have suffered tragic loss by offering engineering solutions to their problems.
1. A patient requires a skin graft but cannot use their own skin for the graft, provide three reasons why polymers will be a good substitute for skin, consider properties relevant to skin function, and state two materials you believe would be good alternatives.(5)
2. A patient requires bone repair. 
	(a) Would you use a polymer in this case? (1)
	(b) If so, what properties make it suitable, and are these properties the same as those needed for skin graft polymers? (2)
	(c) Explain how the same polymer could be used for both skin grafts and bone repair.(2)
(5)
3. Using the data provided, graph specific volume versus temperature for the given polymers. Then, explain why these materials, all classified as polymers, show different graphical representations, considering their glass transition (Tg) and melting (Tm) temperatures.(5)
4. Identify three factors that influence the mechanical properties of polymers (e.g., tensile strength, elastic modulus, ductility). For each factor, describe its effect on these mechanical properties and explain one additional non-mechanical effect it has on the polymer, such as changes in thermal, optical, or processing behavior.(5)

# References


The differences in the specific volume versus temperature curves reflect the varying molecular structures and transition temperatures of these polymers. PVC shows a gradual increase in specific volume until its glass transition temperature (Tg) is reached, around 80-85°C, where the rate of increase accelerates due to increased molecular mobility. A further increase is seen at its melting temperature (Tm). Polypropylene, with a Tg around -10 to 20°C, exhibits a noticeable change in slope at this temperature, indicating the onset of segmental motion. Polyethylene (HDPE), having a very low Tg (-110 to -120°C), shows a change in slope much earlier in the temperature range. The sharp increase in specific volume at its melting temperature (130-135°C) indicates the transition from a semi-crystalline to a molten state. The differences in Tg and Tm are primarily attributed to variations in polymer chain structure, including chain stiffness, intermolecular forces, and crystallinity.
