# 12.2 Fatigue

### Why?
Static Fracture: A constant stress is high enough to cause sudden fracture if existing crack is large enough

Fatigue: At relatively low, fluctuating loads: cracks grow until sudden failure


## Cyclic stresses
Tension
compression
torsion
bending
#### Types of cl 

The text describes how applied stress in fatigue scenarios can be axial, flexural, or torsional. It outlines three main types of fluctuating stress-time modes:
* **Reversed stress cycle:** A symmetrical sinusoidal pattern around a zero mean stress, alternating between equal magnitude tensile and compressive stresses (R = -1).
* **Repeated stress cycle:** An asymmetrical pattern where maximum and minimum stresses are not equal in magnitude relative to the zero-stress level. This cycle is characterized by:
    * **Mean stress (σ<sub>m</sub>):** The average of the maximum (σ<sub>max</sub>) and minimum (σ<sub>min</sub>) stresses: σ<sub>m</sub> = (σ<sub>max</sub> + σ<sub>min</sub>) / 2.
    * **Range of stress (σ<sub>r</sub>):** The difference between the maximum and minimum stresses: σ<sub>r</sub> = σ<sub>max</sub> - σ<sub>min</sub>.
    * **Stress amplitude (σ<sub>a</sub>):** Half the range of stress: σ<sub>a</sub> = σ<sub>r</sub> / 2 = (σ<sub>max</sub> - σ<sub>min</sub>) / 2.
    * **Stress ratio (R):** The ratio of minimum to maximum stress amplitudes: R = σ<sub>min</sub> / σ<sub>max</sub>.
* **Random stress cycle:** Stress amplitude and frequency vary randomly with time.

Tensile stresses are conventionally positive, and compressive stresses are negative.


### Fatigue testing and the S-N curve
S is the stress and N is the number of cycles till failure on a logarithmic scale


### Factors that influence fatigue life
mean stress
surface effects-> to minimise this influence, 
	-> change the design to remove sharp corners
	-> polish the surface to remove scratches  
	-> Increase residual surface compressive stresses: shot peening 
	-> case hardening.
Time 
Corrosion -> more pits are able to form due to the material being eaten away
