# 12.2 Fatigue

### Why?
Static Fracture: A constant stress is high enough to cause sudden fracture if existing crack is large enough

Fatigue: At relatively low, fluctuating loads: cracks grow until sudden failure


## Cyclic stresses
Tension
compression
torsion
bending

can be represented by a simple sin wave:
	+ values = tension
	- values = compression


### Fatigue testing and the S-N curve
S is the stress and N is the number of cycles till failure on a logarithmic scale


### Factors that influence fatigue life
mean stress
surface effects-> to minimise this influence, 
	-> change the design to remove sharp corners
	-> polish the surface to remove scratches  
	-> Increase residual surface compressive stresses: shot peening 
	-> case hardening.
Time 
Corrosion -> more pits are able to form due to the material being eaten away


## Crack initiation and propagation
