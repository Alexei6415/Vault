# 12.2 Fatigue

### Why?
Static Fracture: A constant stress is high enough to cause sudden fracture if existing crack is large enough

Fatigue: At relatively low, fluctuating loads: cracks grow until sudden failure


## Cyclic stresses
Tension
compression
torsion
bending
#### Types of cyclic stresses 

The text describes how applied stress in fatigue scenarios can be axial, flexural, or torsional. It outlines three main types of fluctuating stress-time modes:
* **Reversed stress cycle:** A symmetrical sinusoidal pattern around a zero mean stress, alternating between equal magnitude tensile and compressive stresses (R = -1).
* **Repeated stress cycle:** An asymmetrical pattern where maximum and minimum stresses are not equal in magnitude relative to the zero-stress level. This cycle is characterized by:
    * **Mean stress (σ<sub>m</sub>):** The average of the maximum (σ<sub>max</sub>) and minimum (σ<sub>min</sub>) stresses: σ<sub>m</sub> = (σ<sub>max</sub> + σ<sub>min</sub>) / 2.
    * **Range of stress (σ<sub>r</sub>):** The difference between the maximum and minimum stresses: σ<sub>r</sub> = σ<sub>max</sub> - σ<sub>min</sub>.
    * **Stress amplitude (σ<sub>a</sub>):** Half the range of stress: σ<sub>a</sub> = σ<sub>r</sub> / 2 = (σ<sub>max</sub> - σ<sub>min</sub>) / 2.
    * **Stress ratio (R):** The ratio of minimum to maximum stress amplitudes: R = σ<sub>min</sub> / σ<sub>max</sub>.
* **Random stress cycle:** Stress amplitude and frequency vary randomly with time.

Tensile stresses are conventionally positive, and compressive stresses are negative.


### Fatigue testing and the S-N curve

- **S** is the **stress** (can be maximum stress, σ_max or stress amplitude, σ_a and **N** is the **number of cycles till failure** on a logarithmic scale.
- Tests simulate service stress conditions (stress level, frequency, stress pattern).
- Common test: **rotating-bending beam** (alternating tension and compression, R = -1). Other tests include uniaxial tension-compression and torsional.
- Data plotted as S vs log(N) creates the **S-N curve**.

### Key fatigue properties

- **Fatigue Limit (Endurance Limit):** A limiting stress level (found in some ferrous and titanium alloys) below which fatigue failure will _not_ occur for an infinite number of cycles. Typically 35-60% of tensile strength for steels.
- **Fatigue Strength:** For materials without a fatigue limit (many nonferrous alloys), it's the stress level causing failure at a _specified number of cycles_ (e.g., 10^7)
- **Fatigue Life ($N_f$)** The _number of cycles_ to cause failure at a _specific stress level_.

### Types of fatigue based on cycle number

- **Low-cycle fatigue:** 10^4 ~ 10^5 cycles, high loads, both elastic and plastic strain.
- **High-cycle fatigue:** > 10^4 ~ 10^5  cycles, lower stress levels, totally elastic deformation.



### Scatter in Fatigue Data

- Fatigue data shows significant scatter in the number of cycles to failure at a given stress level.
- S-N curves usually represent average values.
- Statistical methods are used to account for scatter and determine probability of failure.


### Fatigue Failure Process

The process of fatigue failure occurs in three distinct stages:

1.  **Crack Initiation:**
    * A small crack forms at a point of high stress concentration on the component's surface.
    * Nucleation sites include surface scratches, sharp fillets, keyways, threads, dents, etc.
    * Microscopic surface discontinuities from dislocation slip steps can also act as initiation sites.

2.  **Crack Propagation:**
    * The crack incrementally advances with each stress cycle.
    * The fracture surface in this stage shows markings like **beachmarks** and **striations**, both appearing as concentric ridges expanding from the initiation site.
    * **Beachmarks** (macroscopic, visible to the naked eye) indicate interruptions during crack propagation (e.g., periods of machine operation). Each band represents a period of crack growth.
    * **Striations** (microscopic, observed with electron microscope) are thought to represent the crack front advance distance during a single load cycle. Striation width increases with increasing stress range.
    * Localized plastic deformation occurs at crack tips during propagation, even if the applied stress is below the yield strength. This is because stress is amplified at the crack tips.
    * There can be thousands of striations within a single beachmark.
    * The presence of beachmarks and/or striations confirms fatigue failure, but their absence doesn't rule it out. Striations aren't observed in all metals experiencing fatigue and detectability decreases with time due to corrosion or oxide films. Abrasive action can also destroy striations.

3.  **Final Failure:**
    * Occurs very rapidly once the advancing crack reaches a critical size.
    * The fracture surface in this region does *not* show beachmarks or striations.
    * Final failure can be either ductile (with evidence of plastic deformation) or brittle (without plastic deformation).

**Comparison to Your Notes and Added Information:**

Your notes correctly identify crack initiation and propagation. Here are the key additions and clarifications based on the textbook:

* **Final Failure:** Your notes were missing the third stage of fatigue failure, which is the rapid fracture that occurs after the crack reaches a critical size.
* **Distinction between Beachmarks and Striations:** The textbook provides a clearer distinction:
    * **Size:** Beachmarks are macroscopic and visible, while striations are microscopic.
    * **Origin:** Beachmarks indicate periods of interrupted crack growth, whereas striations are generally thought to correspond to a single load cycle.
* **Crack Initiation Details:** The textbook elaborates on common crack nucleation sites and the role of dislocation slip steps.
* **Microscopic Plastic Deformation:** The excerpt highlights the localized plastic deformation at crack tips during propagation, even under stresses below the yield strength.
* **Absence of Markings in Final Failure:** The notes should mention that beachmarks and striations are not present in the final, rapid failure region.
* **Ductile vs. Brittle Final Failure:** The nature of the final failure (ductile or brittle) can be observed in the fracture surface.

### Factors that Affect Fatigue Life

The fatigue behavior of engineering materials is highly sensitive to several variables:

* **Mean Stress Level (\(\sigma_m\)):**
    * Increased mean stress leads to a decrease in fatigue life.
    * S-N curves are often generated for a constant mean stress, typically for reversed cycle loading (\(\sigma_m = 0\)).

* **Surface Effects:**
    * Fatigue cracks usually initiate at the surface where maximum stress and stress amplification sites occur.
    * The condition and configuration of the component surface are crucial.

    * **Design Factors:**
        * Notches and geometrical discontinuities (grooves, holes, keyways, threads) act as stress raisers and crack initiation sites.
        * Sharper discontinuities result in more severe stress concentration.
        * Fatigue failure probability can be reduced by:
            * Avoiding structural irregularities where possible.
            * Implementing design modifications to eliminate sudden contour changes and sharp corners (e.g., using rounded fillets with large radii of curvature at diameter changes in rotating shafts).

    * **Surface Treatments:**
        * **Polishing:** Improves surface finish by removing scratches and grooves introduced during machining, significantly enhancing fatigue life.
        * **Shot Peening:** Introduces residual compressive stresses into a thin outer surface layer by projecting small, hard particles at high velocities. This compressive stress partially nullifies external tensile stress, reducing crack formation likelihood. The depth of compressive stress is typically one-quarter to one-half of the shot diameter.
        * **Case Hardening:** Enhances both surface hardness and fatigue life for steel alloys through carburizing or nitriding processes. These involve exposing the component to a carbonaceous or nitrogenous atmosphere at high temperatures, creating a hard outer layer (case, typically around 1 mm deep) due to atomic diffusion. The improvement results from increased hardness in the case and desired residual compressive stresses formed during the process.

* **Metallurgical Variables**

* **Environment**

## Your Existing Notes:

### Factors that influence fatigue life

* **Mean stress**
* **Surface effects:** To minimise this influence:
    * Change the design to remove sharp corners
    * Polish the surface to remove scratches
    * Increase residual surface compressive stresses: shot peening
    * Case hardening.
* Time
* **Corrosion:** More pits are able to form due to the material being eaten away.
* **Specimen fabrication and surface preparation**
* **Metallurgical variables**
* **Specimen alignment in the apparatus**
* **Test frequency**
* **Explanation of Mean Stress:** The textbook explicitly states that increased mean stress reduces fatigue life and that S-N curves are often for a constant mean stress.
* **Detailed Breakdown of Surface Effects:** The textbook separates surface effects into **Design Factors** and **Surface Treatments**, providing more specific examples and mechanisms for improvement:
    * **Design Factors:** The importance of avoiding or mitigating sharp corners and stress concentrations at geometric discontinuities is emphasized, with rounded fillets as an example.
    * **Surface Treatments:** The mechanisms behind the effectiveness of polishing, shot peening (introducing residual compressive stress), and case hardening (increased surface hardness and compressive stress) are explained in more detail.
* **Environment:** While your notes mention corrosion, the textbook lists "environment" more broadly as a factor.
