# 12.2 Fatigue

### Why?
Static Fracture: A constant stress is high enough to cause sudden fracture if existing crack is large enough

Fatigue: At relatively low, fluctuating loads: cracks grow until sudden failure


## Cyclic stresses
Tension
compression
torsion
bending
#### Types of cyclic stresses 

The text describes how applied stress in fatigue scenarios can be axial, flexural, or torsional. It outlines three main types of fluctuating stress-time modes:
* **Reversed stress cycle:** A symmetrical sinusoidal pattern around a zero mean stress, alternating between equal magnitude tensile and compressive stresses (R = -1).
* **Repeated stress cycle:** An asymmetrical pattern where maximum and minimum stresses are not equal in magnitude relative to the zero-stress level. This cycle is characterized by:
    * **Mean stress (σ<sub>m</sub>):** The average of the maximum (σ<sub>max</sub>) and minimum (σ<sub>min</sub>) stresses: σ<sub>m</sub> = (σ<sub>max</sub> + σ<sub>min</sub>) / 2.
    * **Range of stress (σ<sub>r</sub>):** The difference between the maximum and minimum stresses: σ<sub>r</sub> = σ<sub>max</sub> - σ<sub>min</sub>.
    * **Stress amplitude (σ<sub>a</sub>):** Half the range of stress: σ<sub>a</sub> = σ<sub>r</sub> / 2 = (σ<sub>max</sub> - σ<sub>min</sub>) / 2.
    * **Stress ratio (R):** The ratio of minimum to maximum stress amplitudes: R = σ<sub>min</sub> / σ<sub>max</sub>.
* **Random stress cycle:** Stress amplitude and frequency vary randomly with time.

Tensile stresses are conventionally positive, and compressive stresses are negative.


### Fatigue testing and the S-N curve

- **S** is the **stress** (can be maximum stress, σ_max or stress amplitude, σ_a and **N** is the **number of cycles till failure** on a logarithmic scale.
- Tests simulate service stress conditions (stress level, frequency, stress pattern).
- Common test: **rotating-bending beam** (alternating tension and compression, R = -1). Other tests include uniaxial tension-compression and torsional.
- Data plotted as S vs log(N) creates the **S-N curve**.

### Key fatigue properties

- **Fatigue Limit (Endurance Limit):** A limiting stress level (found in some ferrous and titanium alloys) below which fatigue failure will _not_ occur for an infinite number of cycles. Typically 35-60% of tensile strength for steels.
- **Fatigue Strength:** For materials without a fatigue limit (many nonferrous alloys), it's the stress level causing failure at a _specified number of cycles_ (e.g., 10&lt;sup>7&lt;/sup>).
- **Fatigue Life (N&lt;sub>f&lt;/sub>):** The _number of cycles_ to cause failure at a _specific stress level_.

### Types of fatigue based on cycle number

- **Low-cycle fatigue:** &lt; ~10&lt;sup>4&lt;/sup> - 10&lt;sup>5&lt;/sup> cycles, high loads, both elastic and plastic strain.
- **High-cycle fatigue:** > ~10&lt;sup>4&lt;/sup> - 10&lt;sup>5&lt;/sup> cycles, lower stress levels, totally elastic deformation.

### Factors that influence fatigue life

- **Mean stress**
- **Surface effects:** To minimise this influence:
    - Change the design to remove sharp corners
    - Polish the surface to remove scratches
    - Increase residual surface compressive stresses: shot peening
    - Case hardening.
- Time
- **Corrosion:** More pits are able to form due to the material being eaten away.
- **Specimen fabrication and surface preparation**
- **Metallurgical variables**
- **Specimen alignment in the apparatus**
- **Test frequency**

### Scatter in Fatigue Data

- Fatigue data shows significant scatter in the number of cycles to failure at a given stress level.
- S-N curves usually represent average values.
- Statistical methods are used to account for scatter and determine probability of failure.
