# 10.3 Microstructures and their properties

![[Week 10 - Lecture 3 Microstructures and their Properties.mp4]]

### Mechanical behaviour of Iron-Carbide alloys
In the discussion of the microstructures following all but martensite have ferrite and cementite present.

#### Pearlite
Cementite is significantly stronger then Austenite, so the goal is to increase the concentration of cementite while keeping other properties constant will result in a harder stronger material.

The layer thickness also has an effect. fine pearlite is stronger then coarse pearlite, this is due to there being a higher concentration of grain boundaries per unit volume in fine pearlite and the grain boundaries restrict dislocation motion which in turn means a stronger/harder substance.

#### Spheroidite
- **Cementite Morphology:** The shape and arrangement of cementite (Fe₃C) are different in pearlite (layered structure) and spheroidite (spherelike particles in a ferrite matrix).  
    
- **Hardness and Strength Comparison:** Steels with a **pearlitic microstructure** (both fine and coarse) are generally **stronger and harder** than those with a **spheroidite** microstructure. Figure 10.31a illustrates this, showing higher hardness values for pearlite at the same carbon content.
- **Explanation for Hardness Difference:** The increased hardness and strength in pearlite are due to the greater amount of **boundary area** between the ferrite and cementite phases. These boundaries act as obstacles that reinforce the material and hinder the movement of **dislocations** (which are responsible for plastic deformation). Spheroidite has less of this boundary area.  
    
- **Spheroidite Properties:** The reduced boundary area in spheroidite means that there is less resistance to dislocation motion. As a result, spheroidite is the **softest and weakest** of the steel microstructures discussed.  
    
- **Ductility Comparison:** In contrast to hardness and strength, spheroidized steels are **significantly more ductile** than both fine and coarse pearlite. Figure 10.31b shows much higher ductility (% reduction in area) for spheroidite.  
    
- **Toughness of Spheroidite:** Spheroidite is also noted for being **tough**. This is because any crack that propagates through the ductile ferrite matrix in spheroidite is less likely to encounter the brittle cementite particles, which are present as isolated spheres rather than continuous layers.  
    
#### Bainite
Bainite steels have a finer structure(i.e. smaller ferrite and Fe3C particles), they are generally stronger and harder than pearlitic steels; yet they exhibit a desirable combination of strength and ductility.

#### Martensite
Of the various microstructures listed above, martensite is the strongest and hardest and in addition the most brittle; in fact it has negligible ductility.
The hardness of martensite depends on the carbon content, up to 0.6 wt% C
In contrast to pearlitic steels the strength and hardness of martensite are not thought to be related to microstructure, Rather, these properties are attributed to the effectiveness of the interstitial carbon atoms in hindering dislocation motion and to relatively few slip systems.
Austenite is slightly more dense than martensite, therefore during phase transformations due to quenching big pieces are likely to crack due to the net volume increase, this becomes a problem especially when the carbon content is over 0.5wt%


#### Tempered Martensite
- **Problem with Untempered Martensite:** As-quenched martensite is very hard and brittle, making it unsuitable for most applications. It also contains internal stresses from the rapid quenching process.  
    
- **Tempering as a Solution:** **Tempering** is a heat treatment applied to martensitic steel to enhance its ductility and toughness and relieve internal stresses. It involves heating the steel to a temperature **below the eutectoid temperature** for a specific time. Typical tempering temperatures range from 250°C to 650°C, although stress relief can occur at temperatures as low as 200°C.  
    
- **Transformation Reaction:** Tempering causes the **martensite** (a metastable, body-centred tetragonal single phase supersaturated with carbon) to transform into **tempered martensite**, which consists of the stable phases **ferrite (α)** and very fine, uniformly dispersed **cementite (Fe₃C) particles** within a continuous ferrite matrix.  
    
- **Microstructure:** The microstructure of tempered martensite resembles spheroidite but with **much smaller** cementite particles.  
    
- **Mechanical Properties:** Tempered martensite can achieve a good balance of properties:
    - It remains **nearly as hard and strong as martensite** but with significantly improved **ductility and toughness**.
    - The hardness and strength are attributed to the large **ferrite–cementite phase boundary area** created by the numerous fine cementite particles, which hinder dislocation motion.
    - The continuous ferrite matrix contributes to the improved ductility and toughness.  
        
- **Influence of Tempering Parameters:**
    - **Cementite Particle Size:** Larger cementite particles (resulting from higher tempering temperatures or longer times) lead to a decrease in the ferrite–cementite boundary area, making the material **softer and weaker but more ductile and tougher**.
    - **Temperature and Time:** These are the key variables in the tempering heat treatment, controlling the rate of carbon diffusion and thus the growth of cementite particles and the rate of softening.
    - Prolonged tempering at temperatures approaching the eutectoid temperature can result in the formation of **spheroidite** (over tempered martensite), which is relatively soft and ductile.  
        

**Temper Embrittlement:**

- **Phenomenon:** Tempering some steels can lead to a reduction in toughness, a phenomenon called **temper embrittlement**, as measured by impact tests.  
    
- **Conditions for Occurrence:** This typically happens when steel is tempered above about 575°C followed by slow cooling to room temperature, or when tempering is carried out between approximately 375°C and 575°C.
- **Susceptible Steels:** Steels prone to temper embrittlement usually contain appreciable amounts of alloying elements like manganese, nickel, or chromium, along with trace impurities of antimony, phosphorus, arsenic, and tin.
- **Mechanism:** These alloying and impurity elements tend to segregate at the grain boundaries of the prior austenite, shifting the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature to higher values, potentially making the steel brittle at room temperature. Fracture in these embrittled materials is often intergranular (along grain boundaries).  
    
- **Avoiding Temper Embrittlement:** Temper embrittlement can be prevented by:
    - Careful control of the steel's **composition**.
    - Tempering above 575°C or below 375°C, followed by **quenching** to room temperature.
- **Remediation:** The toughness of embrittled steels can sometimes be improved by reheating to around 600°C and then rapidly cooling to below 300°C.
