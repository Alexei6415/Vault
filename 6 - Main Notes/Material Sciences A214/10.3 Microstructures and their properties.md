# 10.3 Microstructures and their properties

![[Week 10 - Lecture 3 Microstructures and their Properties.mp4]]

### Mechanical behaviour of Iron-Carbide alloys
In the discussion of the microstructures following all but martensite have ferrite and cementite present.

#### Pearlite
Cementite is significantly stronger then Austenite, so the goal is to increase the concentration of cementite while keeping other properties constant will result in a harder stronger material.

The layer thickness also has an effect. fine pearlite is stronger then coarse pearlite, this is due to there being a higher concentration of grain boundaries per unit volume in fine pearlite and the grain boundaries restrict dislocation motion which in turn means a stronger/harder substance.

#### Spheroidite
- **Cementite Morphology:** The shape and arrangement of cementite (Fe₃C) are different in pearlite (layered structure) and spheroidite (spherelike particles in a ferrite matrix).  
    
- **Hardness and Strength Comparison:** Steels with a **pearlitic microstructure** (both fine and coarse) are generally **stronger and harder** than those with a **spheroidite** microstructure. Figure 10.31a illustrates this, showing higher hardness values for pearlite at the same carbon content.
- **Explanation for Hardness Difference:** The increased hardness and strength in pearlite are due to the greater amount of **boundary area** between the ferrite and cementite phases. These boundaries act as obstacles that reinforce the material and hinder the movement of **dislocations** (which are responsible for plastic deformation). Spheroidite has less of this boundary area.  
    
- **Spheroidite Properties:** The reduced boundary area in spheroidite means that there is less resistance to dislocation motion. As a result, spheroidite is the **softest and weakest** of the steel microstructures discussed.  
    
- **Ductility Comparison:** In contrast to hardness and strength, spheroidized steels are **significantly more ductile** than both fine and coarse pearlite. Figure 10.31b shows much higher ductility (% reduction in area) for spheroidite.  
    
- **Toughness of Spheroidite:** Spheroidite is also noted for being **tough**. This is because any crack that propagates through the ductile ferrite matrix in spheroidite is less likely to encounter the brittle cementite particles, which are present as isolated spheres rather than continuous layers.  
    
#### Bainite
Bainite steels have a finer structure(i.e. smaller ferrite and Fe3C particles), they are generally stronger and harder than pearlitic steels; yet they exhibit a desirable combination of strength and ductility.
