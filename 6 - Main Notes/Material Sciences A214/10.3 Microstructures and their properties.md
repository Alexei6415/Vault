# 10.3 Microstructures and their properties

![[Week 10 - Lecture 3 Microstructures and their Properties.mp4]]

### Mechanical behaviour of Iron-Carbide alloys
In the discussion of the microstructures following all but martensite have ferrite and cementite present.

#### Pearlite
Cementite is significantly stronger then Austenite, so the goal is to increase the concentration of cementite while keeping other properties constant will result in a harder stronger material.

The layer thickness also has an effect. fine pearlite is stronger then coarse pearlite, this is due to there being a higher concentration of grain boundaries per unit volume in fine pearlite and the grain boundaries restrict dislocation motion which in turn means a stronger/harder substance.

#### Spheroidite
- **Cementite Morphology:** The shape and arrangement of cementite (Fe₃C) are different in pearlite (layered structure) and spheroidite (spherelike particles in a ferrite matrix).  
    
- **Hardness and Strength Comparison:** Steels with a **pearlitic microstructure** (both fine and coarse) are generally **stronger and harder** than those with a **spheroidite** microstructure. Figure 10.31a illustrates this, showing higher hardness values for pearlite at the same carbon content.
- **Explanation for Hardness Difference:** The increased hardness and strength in pearlite are due to the greater amount of **boundary area** between the ferrite and cementite phases. These boundaries act as obstacles that reinforce the material and hinder the movement of **dislocations** (which are responsible for plastic deformation). Spheroidite has less of this boundary area.  
    
- **Spheroidite Properties:** The reduced boundary area in spheroidite means that there is less resistance to dislocation motion. As a result, spheroidite is the **softest and weakest** of the steel microstructures discussed.  
    
- **Ductility Comparison:** In contrast to hardness and strength, spheroidized steels are **significantly more ductile** than both fine and coarse pearlite. Figure 10.31b shows much higher ductility (% reduction in area) for spheroidite.  
    
- **Toughness of Spheroidite:** Spheroidite is also noted for being **tough**. This is because any crack that propagates through the ductile ferrite matrix in spheroidite is less likely to encounter the brittle cementite particles, which are present as isolated spheres rather than continuous layers.  
    
#### Bainite
Bainite steels have a finer structure(i.e. smaller ferrite and Fe3C particles), they are generally stronger and harder than pearlitic steels; yet they exhibit a desirable combination of strength and ductility.

#### Martensite
Of the various microstructures listed above, martensite is the strongest and hardest and in addition the most brittle; in fact it has negligible ductility.
The hardness of martensite depends on the carbon content, up to 0.6 wt% C
In contrast to pearlitic steels the strength and hardness of martensite are not thought to be related to microstructure, Rather, these properties are attributed to the effectiveness of the interstitial carbon atoms in hindering dislocation motion and to relatively few slip systems.
Austenite is slightly more dense than martensite, therefore during phase transformations due to quenching big pieces are likely to crack due to the net volume increase, this becomes a problem especially when the carbon content is over 0.5wt%


#### Tempered Martensite
- **Problem with Untempered Martensite:** As-quenched martensite is very hard and brittle, making it unsuitable for most applications. It also contains internal stresses from the rapid quenching process.  
    
- **Tempering as a Solution:** **Tempering** is a heat treatment applied to martensitic steel to enhance its ductility and toughness and relieve internal stresses. It involves heating the steel to a temperature **below the eutectoid temperature** for a specific time. Typical tempering temperatures range from 250°C to 650°C, although stress relief can occur at temperatures as low as 200°C.  
    
- **Transformation Reaction:** Tempering causes the **martensite** (a metastable, body-centred tetragonal single phase supersaturated with carbon) to transform into **tempered martensite**, which consists of the stable phases **ferrite (α)** and very fine, uniformly dispersed **cementite (Fe₃C) particles** within a continuous ferrite matrix.  
    
- **Microstructure:** The microstructure of tempered martensite resembles spheroidite but with **much smaller** cementite particles.  
    
- **Mechanical Properties:** Tempered martensite can achieve a good balance of properties:
    - It remains **nearly as hard and strong as martensite** but with significantly improved **ductility and toughness**.
    - The hardness and strength are attributed to the large **ferrite–cementite phase boundary area** created by the numerous fine cementite particles, which hinder dislocation motion.
    - The continuous ferrite matrix contributes to the improved ductility and toughness.  
        
- **Influence of Tempering Parameters:**
    - **Cementite Particle Size:** Larger cementite particles (resulting from higher tempering temperatures or longer times) lead to a decrease in the ferrite–cementite boundary area, making the material **softer and weaker but more ductile and tougher**.
    - **Temperature and Time:** These are the key variables in the tempering heat treatment, controlling the rate of carbon diffusion and thus the growth of cementite particles and the rate of softening.
    - Prolonged tempering at temperatures approaching the eutectoid temperature can result in the formation of **spheroidite** (over tempered martensite), which is relatively soft and ductile.  
        

**Temper Embrittlement:**

- **Phenomenon:** Tempering some steels can lead to a reduction in toughness, a phenomenon called **temper embrittlement**, as measured by impact tests.  
    
- **Conditions for Occurrence:** This typically happens when steel is tempered above about 575°C followed by slow cooling to room temperature, or when tempering is carried out between approximately 375°C and 575°C.
- **Susceptible Steels:** Steels prone to temper embrittlement usually contain appreciable amounts of alloying elements like manganese, nickel, or chromium, along with trace impurities of antimony, phosphorus, arsenic, and tin.
- **Mechanism:** These alloying and impurity elements tend to segregate at the grain boundaries of the prior austenite, shifting the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature to higher values, potentially making the steel brittle at room temperature. Fracture in these embrittled materials is often intergranular (along grain boundaries).  
    
- **Avoiding Temper Embrittlement:** Temper embrittlement can be prevented by:
    - Careful control of the steel's **composition**.
    - Tempering above 575°C or below 375°C, followed by **quenching** to room temperature.
- **Remediation:** The toughness of embrittled steels can sometimes be improved by reheating to around 600°C and then rapidly cooling to below 300°C.

#  SUMMARY

## The Kinetics of Phase Transformations

* Nucleation and growth are the two steps involved in the production of a new phase.
* Two types of nucleation are possible: homogeneous and heterogeneous.
    * For homogeneous nucleation, nuclei of the new phase form uniformly throughout the parent phase.
    * For heterogeneous nucleation, nuclei form preferentially at surfaces of structural inhomogeneities (e.g., container surfaces, insoluble impurities).
* In nucleation theory, activation free energy (ΔG\*) represents an energy barrier that must be overcome in order for nucleation to occur.
* When a cluster of atoms achieves a critical radius (r\*), nucleus growth continues spontaneously.
* The activation free energy for heterogeneous nucleation is lower than ΔG\* for homogeneous nucleation.
* For transformations that are induced by temperature alterations, when rate of temperature change is such that equilibrium conditions are not maintained, transformation temperature is raised (for heating) and lowered (for cooling). These phenomena are termed superheating and supercooling, respectively.
* A smaller degree of supercooling (or superheating) is required for heterogeneous nucleation than for homogenous nucleation—that is, ΔT<sub>het</sub> < ΔT<sub>hom</sub> .
* For typical solid transformations, a plot of fraction transformation versus logarithm of time yields an S-shape curve, as depicted schematically in Figure 10.10.
* The time dependence of degree of transformation is represented by the Avrami equation, Equation 10.17.
* Transformation rate is taken as the reciprocal of time required for a transformation to proceed halfway to its completion, Equation 10.18.

## Isothermal Transformation Diagrams

* Isothermal transformation (or time-temperature-transformation, TTT) diagrams present the dependence of transformation progress on time while temperature is maintained constant. Each diagram is generated for a specific alloy and plots temperature versus the logarithm of time; curves are included for the beginning, 50%, and 100% transformation completion.

## Continuous-Cooling Transformation Diagrams

* Isothermal transformation diagrams may be modified for continuous-cooling heat treatments by the shifting of transformation beginning and ending curves to longer times and lower temperatures; the resulting plots are termed continuous-cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams.
* Times at which continuous-cooling transformations start and conclude are determined by intersections of cooling curves with the respective transformation beginning and ending curves of the CCT diagrams.
* Isothermal and continuous-cooling transformation diagrams make possible the prediction of microstructural products for specified heat treatments. This feature was demonstrated for alloys of iron and carbon.

## Summary of Iron–Carbon Alloy Microstructures

* **Coarse and fine pearlite**—the alternating 𝛼-ferrite and cementite layers are thinner for fine than for coarse pearlite. Coarse pearlite forms at higher temperatures (isothermally) and for slower cooling rates (continuous cooling).
* **Bainite**—this has a very fine structure that is composed of a ferrite matrix and elongated cementite particles. It forms at lower temperatures/higher cooling rates than fine pearlite.
* **Spheroidite**—this is composed of spherelike cementite particles that are embedded in a ferrite matrix. Heating fine/coarse pearlite or bainite at about 700°C for several hours produces spheroidite.
* **Martensite**—this has platelike or needlelike grains of an iron–carbon solid solution that has a body-centered tetragonal crystal structure. Martensite is produced by rapidly quenching austenite to a sufficiently low temperature so as to prevent carbon diffusion and the formation of pearlite and/or bainite.
* **Tempered martensite**—this consists of very small cementite particles within a ferrite matrix. Heating martensite at temperatures within the range of about 250°C to 650°C results in its transformation to tempered martensite.
* The addition of some alloying elements (other than carbon) shifts pearlite and bainite noses on a continuous-cooling transformation diagram to longer times, making the transformation to martensite more favorable (and an alloy more heat-treatable).

## Mechanical Behavior of Iron–Carbon Alloys

* Martensitic steels are the hardest and strongest, yet most brittle.
* Tempered martensite is very strong but relatively ductile.
* Bainite has a desirable strength-ductility combination but is not as strong as tempered martensite.
* Fine pearlite is harder, stronger, and more brittle than coarse pearlite.
* Spheroidite is the softest and most ductile of the microstructures discussed.
* Embrittlement of some steel alloys results when specific alloying and impurity elements are present and upon tempering within a definite temperature range.

## Shape-Memory Alloys

* These alloys may be deformed and then return to their predeformed sizes/shapes upon heating.
* Deformation occurs by the migration of twin boundaries. A martensite-to-austenite phase transformation accompanies the reversion back to the original size/shape.
