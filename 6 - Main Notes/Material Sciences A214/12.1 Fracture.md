# 12.1 Fracture

#### Why?
Can cause breaks which will be expensive or cause damage to other components.
And because they can put human lives at risk.

The provided text highlights the severity of fracture, especially brittle fracture, because it occurs suddenly and catastrophically without warning due to spontaneous and rapid crack propagation. In contrast, ductile fracture provides a warning through plastic deformation before failure, allowing for preventative measures. Furthermore, ductile fracture generally requires more energy to occur, indicating greater toughness of the material.

### Types of Failure
1. Static Fracture
2. Fatigue
3. Creep

### Fracture
Occurs in response to an imposed stress that is static (constant or slowly changing with time) at temperatures low relative to the material's melting point. Fracture involves two main steps: **crack formation** and **crack propagation**. The mode of fracture is heavily influenced by how the crack propagates.

**Two main modes of fracture in metals:**

* **Ductile Fracture:**
    * Characterized by **extensive plastic deformation** in the vicinity of an advancing crack.
    * Crack propagation is relatively **slow**.
    * The crack is often **stable**, meaning it resists further extension unless the applied stress increases.
    * Significant **gross deformation** is usually visible at the fracture surfaces (e.g., twisting and tearing).
    * Involves **high energy absorption** before fracture.
    * Ductile fracture is generally **preferred** because it provides warning of impending failure.

* **Brittle Fracture:**
    * Cracks spread **extremely rapidly** with very little or no accompanying plastic deformation.
    * Crack propagation is **unstable** and continues spontaneously once started, without an increase in applied stress.
    * Involves **low energy absorption**.
    * Occurs **suddenly and catastrophically** without warning.

Whether a fracture is ductile or brittle depends on factors such as the material's ability to undergo plastic deformation, which can be quantified by percent elongation and percent reduction in area. Ductility is also influenced by temperature, strain rate, and the stress state. While many metal alloys exhibit ductile fracture under tensile stress, ceramics are typically brittle, and polymers can show a range of behaviours.

Fracture is tested in many different ways.

#### Ductile vs Brittle

* **Ductile:** High percentage reduction in area (%RA), significant necking (thinning down of the specimen's cross-section).
* **Brittle:** Low percentage reduction in area (%RA), almost no necking (thinning down of the specimen's cross-section).

#### Ductile Fracture Surface

Ductile fracture surfaces have distinct characteristics at both macroscopic and microscopic levels.

**Macroscopic Features:**

* **Highly Ductile Fracture:** Found in very soft metals like pure gold and lead at room temperature, as well as some metals, polymers, and inorganic glasses at elevated temperatures. Specimens neck down to a point fracture, exhibiting virtually 100% reduction in area (Figure 8.1a).
* **Moderately Ductile Fracture:** The most common type for ductile metals. Fracture is preceded by a moderate amount of necking (Figure 8.1b). The fracture process typically occurs in several stages (Figure 8.2):
    * **Initial Necking (a)**
    * **Microvoid Formation (b):** Small cavities form in the interior of the cross-section after necking begins.
    * **Microvoid Coalescence (c):** These microvoids enlarge, come together, and coalesce to form an elliptical crack with its long axis perpendicular to the stress direction. The crack grows parallel to its major axis through further microvoid coalescence.
    * **Crack Propagation (d)**
    * **Final Shear Fracture (e):** Rapid propagation of the crack around the outer perimeter of the neck by shear deformation at approximately 45° to the tensile axis (where shear stress is maximum). This characteristic surface contour is often called a **cup-and-cone fracture**. One fracture surface resembles a cup, and the other a cone (Figure 8.3a).
* The central interior region of a cup-and-cone fracture has an irregular and fibrous appearance, indicating plastic deformation. The outer region shows a shear lip at an angle of about 45°.

**Microscopic Features (Fractography):**

###### Fractography

Fractographic studies involve examining the fracture surface at high magnification using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). This reveals the topographical features of the fracture surfaces with better resolution and depth of field than optical microscopy.

At the Centre (Fibrous Region):

* Examination of the fibrous central region of a cup-and-cone fracture with an SEM reveals numerous spherical indentations called "**dimples**" (Figure 8.4a). This structure is characteristic of fracture resulting from uniaxial tensile failure.
* Each dimple is half of a microvoid that formed and then separated during the fracture process.

At the Edge (Shear Lip):

![[Pasted image 20250428163429.png]]

* Dimples also form on the 45° shear lip of the cup-and-cone fracture. However, these dimples are **elongated or C-shaped** (Figure 8.4b).
* This elongated or parabolic shape can be indicative of shear failure.

The analysis of these fractographs provides valuable information about the fracture mode, the stress state, and the site of crack initiation.

##### Brittle Fracture

Brittle fracture occurs without any noticeable plastic deformation and is characterised by rapid crack propagation. The crack moves in a direction almost perpendicular to the applied tensile stress, resulting in a relatively flat fracture surface, as shown in Figure 8.1c. Fracture surfaces of materials failing in a brittle manner exhibit distinctive patterns, and signs of gross plastic deformation are absent.

![[Pasted image 20250428163006.png]]

* In some steel components, **chevron markings** (V-shaped patterns) may form near the centre of the fracture cross-section, pointing back towards the origin of the crack (Figure 8.5a).
* Other brittle fracture surfaces show **radial fan-shaped ridges** emanating from the crack's origin (Figure 8.5b).
* These marking patterns are often visible to the naked eye in coarser-grained materials.
* Very hard and fine-grained metals may not exhibit any discernible fracture pattern.
* Brittle fracture in amorphous materials, like ceramic glasses, produces a relatively shiny and smooth surface.

###### Fractography

Microscopic examination of brittle fracture surfaces reveals different features depending on the material's microstructure:

We observe 2 different fracture surfaces:

**Transgranular Fracture (or Transcrystalline Fracture):**

![[Pasted image 20250428163556.png]]

* The crack propagates **across the grains**, meaning it passes through the individual crystals of the material (Figure 8.6a).
* This results in a fracture surface that appears **grainy or faceted** macroscopically (Figure 8.3b) due to the changing orientation of cleavage planes from one grain to another.
* The scanning electron micrograph in Figure 8.6b shows a typical transgranular fracture surface in ductile cast iron.

**Intergranular Fracture:**

![[Pasted image 20250428163644.png]]

* The crack propagates **along the grain boundaries**, meaning it follows the interfaces between the individual crystals (Figure 8.7a).
* The scanning electron micrograph in Figure 8.7b illustrates a typical intergranular fracture, clearly showing the three-dimensional arrangement of the grains.
* This type of fracture usually occurs after processes that weaken or embrittle the grain boundary regions have taken place.


#### Foundations of Fracture Mechanics
previously : used tensile testing(no concern for pre-existing flaws)
Fracture mechanics takes into account these flaws.

###### Flaws
Voids, Inclusions, Scratches, notches or pre-existing cracks

sometimes we place notches on purpose to test fracture point

These flaws act as stress raisers, amplifying the applied stress at their tips.
The maximum stress ($\sigma_m$) at a crack tip can be approximated by $\sigma_m = 2\sigma_0 \sqrt{\frac{a}{\rho_t}}$, where $\sigma_0$ is the nominal stress, $a$ is the crack length (or half for internal cracks), and $\rho_t$ is the tip radius of curvature.
The stress concentration factor ($K_t$) is defined as $K_t = \frac{\sigma_m}{\sigma_0} = 2\sqrt{\frac{a}{\rho_t}}$.
Stress amplification is more significant in brittle materials as ductile materials can experience plastic deformation to redistribute stress.

###### Fracture toughness: General case:
$$K_c = Y\sigma_c \sqrt{\pi \alpha}$$
Here, $\sigma_c$ is the critical stress for crack propagation, $Y$ is a dimensionless geometry factor, and $a$ is the crack length (or half for internal cracks). The units of $K_c$ are MPa√m or psi√in.

For relatively thick specimens under plane strain conditions, the fracture toughness is denoted as $K_{Ic}$, and the equation becomes $K_{Ic} = Y\sigma_c \sqrt{\pi a}$.
Plane strain implies no strain component perpendicular to the crack face.
$K_{Ic}$ is a fundamental material property that indicates a material's resistance to brittle fracture in the presence of a crack under plane strain.

NB: high yield strength does not imply high fracture toughness.
Fracture toughness ($K_{Ic}$) generally decreases with increasing strain rate and decreasing temperature, and it increases with a reduction in grain size. An increase in yield strength often leads to a decrease in $K_{Ic}$.

Fracture mechanics principles can be used in design to determine critical stress levels or maximum allowable flaw sizes for a given material with a known fracture toughness. Non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques are used to detect flaws in materials and structures.
