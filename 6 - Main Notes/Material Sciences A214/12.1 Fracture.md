# 12.1 Fracture

#### Why?
Can cause breaks which will be expensive or cause damage to other components.
And because they can put human lives at risk.

The provided text highlights the severity of fracture, especially brittle fracture, because it occurs suddenly and catastrophically without warning due to spontaneous and rapid crack propagation. In contrast, ductile fracture provides a warning through plastic deformation before failure, allowing for preventative measures. Furthermore, ductile fracture generally requires more energy to occur, indicating greater toughness of the material.

### Types of Failure
1. Static Fracture
2. Fatigue
3. Creep

### Fracture
Occurs in response to an imposed stress that is static (constant or slowly changing with time) at temperatures low relative to the material's melting point. Fracture involves two main steps: **crack formation** and **crack propagation**. The mode of fracture is heavily influenced by how the crack propagates.

**Two main modes of fracture in metals:**

* **Ductile Fracture:**
    * Characterized by **extensive plastic deformation** in the vicinity of an advancing crack.
    * Crack propagation is relatively **slow**.
    * The crack is often **stable**, meaning it resists further extension unless the applied stress increases.
    * Significant **gross deformation** is usually visible at the fracture surfaces (e.g., twisting and tearing).
    * Involves **high energy absorption** before fracture.
    * Ductile fracture is generally **preferred** because it provides warning of impending failure.

* **Brittle Fracture:**
    * Cracks spread **extremely rapidly** with very little or no accompanying plastic deformation.
    * Crack propagation is **unstable** and continues spontaneously once started, without an increase in applied stress.
    * Involves **low energy absorption**.
    * Occurs **suddenly and catastrophically** without warning.

Whether a fracture is ductile or brittle depends on factors such as the material's ability to undergo plastic deformation, which can be quantified by percent elongation and percent reduction in area. Ductility is also influenced by temperature, strain rate, and the stress state. While many metal alloys exhibit ductile fracture under tensile stress, ceramics are typically brittle, and polymers can show a range of behaviours.

Fracture is tested in many different ways.

#### Ductile vs Brittle
Ductile: high% RA, lot of Necking(thinning down of specimen cross section)
Brittle: low% RA, almost no necking(thinning down of specimen cross section)

###### Fractography
Viewing fracture point with SEM

At Edge

Both have Dimples however at the edge they are stretched.




##### Brittle Fracture
the fracture area is flat ( no deformation)

###### Fractography
we observe 2 different fracture surfaces

Transgranular -> crack propagates across the grains --> results on a very grainy image

Intergranular -> propagates along the grain boundaries

#### Foundations of Fracture Mechanics
previously : used tensile testing(no concern for pre-existing flaws)
Fracture mechanics takes into account these flaws.

###### Flaws
Voids, Inclusions, Scratches, notches or pre-existing cracks

sometimes we place notches on purpose to test fracture point


###### Fracture toughness: General case:
$$K_c = Y\sigma_c \sqrt{\pi \alpha}$$


NB: high yield strength does not imply high fracture toughness.

##### Ductile to brittle transition

###### Effect of material type/alloying
can shift the graph to the right or left so could be brittle at high temperatures
