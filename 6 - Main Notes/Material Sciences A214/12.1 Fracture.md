# 12.1 Fracture

#### Why?
Can cause breaks which will be expensive or cause damage to other components.
And because they can put human lives at risk.

The provided text highlights the severity of fracture, especially brittle fracture, because it occurs suddenly and catastrophically without warning due to spontaneous and rapid crack propagation. In contrast, ductile fracture provides a warning through plastic deformation before failure, allowing for preventative measures. Furthermore, ductile fracture generally requires more energy to occur, indicating greater toughness of the material.

### Types of Failure
1. Static Fracture
2. Fatigue
3. Creep

### Fracture
Occurs in response to an imposed stress that is static (constant or slowly changing with time) at temperatures low relative to the material's melting point. Fracture involves two main steps: **crack formation** and **crack propagation**. The mode of fracture is heavily influenced by how the crack propagates.

**Two main modes of fracture in metals:**

* **Ductile Fracture:**
    * Characterized by **extensive plastic deformation** in the vicinity of an advancing crack.
    * Crack propagation is relatively **slow**.
    * The crack is often **stable**, meaning it resists further extension unless the applied stress increases.
    * Significant **gross deformation** is usually visible at the fracture surfaces (e.g., twisting and tearing).
    * Involves **high energy absorption** before fracture.
    * Ductile fracture is generally **preferred** because it provides warning of impending failure.

* **Brittle Fracture:**
    * Cracks spread **extremely rapidly** with very little or no accompanying plastic deformation.
    * Crack propagation is **unstable** and continues spontaneously once started, without an increase in applied stress.
    * Involves **low energy absorption**.
    * Occurs **suddenly and catastrophically** without warning.

Whether a fracture is ductile or brittle depends on factors such as the material's ability to undergo plastic deformation, which can be quantified by percent elongation and percent reduction in area. Ductility is also influenced by temperature, strain rate, and the stress state. While many metal alloys exhibit ductile fracture under tensile stress, ceramics are typically brittle, and polymers can show a range of behaviours.

Fracture is tested in many different ways.

#### Ductile vs Brittle

* **Ductile:** High percentage reduction in area (%RA), significant necking (thinning down of the specimen's cross-section).
* **Brittle:** Low percentage reduction in area (%RA), almost no necking (thinning down of the specimen's cross-section).

#### Ductile Fracture Surface

Ductile fracture surfaces have distinct characteristics at both macroscopic and microscopic levels.

**Macroscopic Features:**

* **Highly Ductile Fracture:** Found in very soft metals like pure gold and lead at room temperature, as well as some metals, polymers, and inorganic glasses at elevated temperatures. Specimens neck down to a point fracture, exhibiting virtually 100% reduction in area (Figure 8.1a).
* **Moderately Ductile Fracture:** The most common type for ductile metals. Fracture is preceded by a moderate amount of necking (Figure 8.1b). The fracture process typically occurs in several stages (Figure 8.2):
    * **Initial Necking (a)**
    * **Microvoid Formation (b):** Small cavities form in the interior of the cross-section after necking begins.
    * **Microvoid Coalescence (c):** These microvoids enlarge, come together, and coalesce to form an elliptical crack with its long axis perpendicular to the stress direction. The crack grows parallel to its major axis through further microvoid coalescence.
    * **Crack Propagation (d)**
    * **Final Shear Fracture (e):** Rapid propagation of the crack around the outer perimeter of the neck by shear deformation at approximately 45° to the tensile axis (where shear stress is maximum). This characteristic surface contour is often called a **cup-and-cone fracture**. One fracture surface resembles a cup, and the other a cone (Figure 8.3a).
* The central interior region of a cup-and-cone fracture has an irregular and fibrous appearance, indicating plastic deformation. The outer region shows a shear lip at an angle of about 45°.

**Microscopic Features (Fractography):**

###### Fractography

Fractographic studies involve examining the fracture surface at high magnification using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). This reveals the topographical features of the fracture surfaces with better resolution and depth of field than optical microscopy.

At the Centre (Fibrous Region):

* Examination of the fibrous central region of a cup-and-cone fracture with an SEM reveals numerous spherical indentations called "**dimples**" (Figure 8.4a). This structure is characteristic of fracture resulting from uniaxial tensile failure.
* Each dimple is half of a microvoid that formed and then separated during the fracture process.

At the Edge (Shear Lip):

![[Pasted image 20250428163429.png]]

* Dimples also form on the 45° shear lip of the cup-and-cone fracture. However, these dimples are **elongated or C-shaped** (Figure 8.4b).
* This elongated or parabolic shape can be indicative of shear failure.

The analysis of these fractographs provides valuable information about the fracture mode, the stress state, and the site of crack initiation.

##### Brittle Fracture
the fracture area is flat ( no deformation)

###### Fractography
we observe 2 different fracture surfaces

Transgranular -> crack propagates across the grains --> results on a very grainy image
![[Pasted image 20250428163556.png]]

Intergranular -> propagates along the grain boundaries

#### Foundations of Fracture Mechanics
previously : used tensile testing(no concern for pre-existing flaws)
Fracture mechanics takes into account these flaws.

###### Flaws
Voids, Inclusions, Scratches, notches or pre-existing cracks

sometimes we place notches on purpose to test fracture point


###### Fracture toughness: General case:
$$K_c = Y\sigma_c \sqrt{\pi \alpha}$$


NB: high yield strength does not imply high fracture toughness.

###### Effect of material type/alloying
can shift the graph to the right or left so could be brittle at high temperatures
