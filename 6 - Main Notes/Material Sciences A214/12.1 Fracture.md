# 12.1 Fracture

#### Why?
Can cause breaks which will be expensive or cause damage to other components.
And because they can put human lives at risk.

### Types of Failure
1. Static Fracture 
2. Fatigue
3. Creep

### Fracture
Occurs in plastic deformation and at fatigue failure and creep rupture

Facture is tested in many different ways.


#### Ductile vs Brittle
Ductile: high% RA, lot of Necking(thinning down of specimen cross section)
Brittle: low% RA, almost no necking(thinning down of specimen cross section)

Ductile Fracture surface:

###### Fractography
Viewing fracture point with SEM

At Edge

Both have Dimples however at the edge they are stretched.




##### Brittle Fracture
the fracture area is flat ( no deformation)

###### Fractography
we observe 2 different fracture surfaces

Transgranular -> crack propagates across the grains --> results on a very grainy image

Intergranular -> propagates along the grain boundaries

#### Foundations of Fracture Mechanics
previously : used tensile testing(no concern for pre-existing flaws)
Fracture mechanics takes into account these flaws.

###### Flaws
Voids, Inclusions, Scratches, notches or pre-existing cracks

sometimes we place notches on purpose to test fracture point


###### Fracture toughness: General case:
$$K_c = Y\sigma_c \sqrt{\pi \alpha}$$


NB: high yield strength does not imply high fracture toughness.



#### Fracture toughness/ impact testing

##### Ductile to brittle transition

###### Effect of material type/alloying
can shift the graph to the right or left so could be brittle at high temperatures
