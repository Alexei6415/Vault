# 11.2 Thermal processing of metals

#### Why should we care about thermal processing?
- Needed to 
	- Relieve residual stresses ( for example from welding)
	- increase softness/ductility/toughness for other processes such as machining/forming
	- produce a specific microstructure. For Example
		- Combination of strength and ductility
		- Higher strength metals for high stress applications ( for example, precipitation hardening)

#### Annealing

Annealing is a crucial heat treatment applied to metals to achieve a desired set of properties by heating the material to an elevated temperature for an extended period, followed by slow cooling. The main goals of annealing are to:

* Relieve internal stresses.
* Increase softness, ductility, and toughness.
* Produce a specific microstructure.

The annealing process generally involves three stages:

1.  **Heating:** Raising the metal to a specific, desired temperature.
2.  **Holding (Soaking):** Maintaining the metal at this temperature for a sufficient duration to allow for the necessary transformations to occur throughout the material. The time required depends on the size and geometry of the workpiece.
3.  **Cooling:** Gradually reducing the temperature, usually back to room temperature. The cooling rate is critical to prevent the introduction of new internal stresses that could lead to warping or cracking. Faster heating and cooling rates can create temperature gradients within the material.

##### Stress Relief Annealing:

This type of annealing is performed to relieve internal residual stresses that may have developed due to:

* **Plastic deformation processes:** Such as machining, grinding, or cold working.
* **Non-uniform cooling:** Occurring after processing or fabrication at high temperatures, like in welding or casting.
* **Phase transformations:** Where parent and product phases have different densities upon cooling (e.g., martensite formation).

The primary benefit of stress relief annealing is preventing distortion and warpage in the metal component. It is carried out at relatively lower temperatures, ensuring that the existing physical microstructure and the effects of previous cold working or heat treatments are not significantly altered.

##### Process Annealing

Process annealing is conducted below the eutectoid temperature (for ferrous alloys) but above the recrystallization temperature of the metal. Its main purpose is to counteract the effects of cold working, which increases the hardness and reduces the ductility of the metal (strain hardening). This is achieved by allowing recovery and recrystallization processes to occur within the metal's microstructure.

Key benefits and applications of process annealing include:

* **Increased ductility and softness:** Making the metal easier to work with.
* **Enabling further deformation:** It is commonly employed during fabrication procedures that involve extensive plastic deformation, allowing the process to continue without fracture or requiring excessive energy. A fine-grained microstructure is typically desired after process annealing.
* **Prevention of surface oxidation (scaling):** Can be minimized by using relatively lower annealing temperatures or by performing the annealing in a nonoxidizing atmosphere.

### Normalizing:
Goals; refine and "normalize" grains of plastically deformed steel.
Austenitizing 55 deg C above the upper critical temperatures.(A3 and Acm)
cooling in air: fine pearlite and proeutectoid phase.
Improves toughness and produces reproducible microstructure.

#### Full anneal:
Goal: prepares a steel for machining or forming
low and medium carbon steels
hypoeutectoid: 50 deg C above A3
hypereutectoid: 50 deg C above A1
Furnace cool: coarse pearlite and proeutectoid phase.

#### Spheroidizing 
Medium to high carbon steels.
Several methods:
	Just below A1 at 700( longer times for coarse pearlite
	just above A1 followed by slow cooling/holding at temperatures just below A1
	heating and cooling within 50 deg of A1
Goal: enhance ductility/ maximise softness for machining
decomposition of lamellar Fe3C into spheroid particles

### Heat treatment of steels
Better to be relabelled as "Heat treatment to form martensitic steels"
Maximum amount of martensite formed: to optimize properties through tempering





##### Alloy composition

###### Hardenability: jominy end-quench test
Ability of alloy steel to transform to martensite( be hardened ) for a particular quenching treatment
Jominy end Quench test: measures how hardness changes along specimen length

Hardenability curves:
Higher hardenability for higher carbon content
##### Quenching medium
Severity of quench: rate of cooling
Water:
	rel rapid
Oil:
	rel moderate
Air:
	rel slow
Furnace
	slowest
More Agitation: increase quenching severity

##### Size and shape of specimen

heat energy conducted to surface and dissipated.
Influence of bar diameter

surface area to mass ratio
	Plates > squares > cylinders
	the higher the surface area to mass ratio the quicker it will cool/ the greater the hardness profile

### Precipitation hardening
Strengthening and hardening of metal alloys through formation of small, uniformly dispersed particles (precipitates)
Age hardening
Example : aluminium-copper binary system

requirements:
	rel large solubility limit of one component
	solubility that rapidly decrease with temperature 
	composition less than maximum solubility limit
	Specific heat treatment:
		Solution heat treatment
		Precipitation heat treatment
	Lattice distortion at precipitate-matrix boundary


Over aging and under aging

Precipitation hardening, also known as age hardening, is a heat treatment process used to strengthen alloys. During this process, the material undergoes aging, where precipitates form and impede dislocation movement, increasing strength.

- **Underaging** occurs when the aging process is stopped too early. The precipitates are small and not fully developed, which means they cannot effectively block dislocations. As a result, the material does not achieve its maximum strength.
    
- **Overaging** happens when the aging process continues for too long. The precipitates grow too large and become less effective at blocking dislocations. This leads to a decrease in strength and hardness.
    

The key is to find the optimal aging time to maximize the material's properties.

### Natural aging
Precipitation hardening that occurs at ambient conditions - rivets

### Artificial Aging
Precipitation hardening that occurs at elevated temperature conditions - for e.g. creep
