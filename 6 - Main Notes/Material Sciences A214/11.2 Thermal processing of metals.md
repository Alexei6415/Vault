# 11.2 Thermal processing of metals

#### Why should we care about thermal processing?
- Needed to 
	- Relieve residual stresses ( for example from welding)
	- increase softness/ductility/toughness for other processes such as machining/forming
	- produce a specific microstructure. For Example
		- Combination of strength and ductility
		- Higher strength metals for high stress applications ( for example, precipitation hardening)

#### Annealing

Annealing is a crucial heat treatment applied to metals to achieve a desired set of properties by heating the material to an elevated temperature for an extended period, followed by slow cooling. The main goals of annealing are to:

* Relieve internal stresses.
* Increase softness, ductility, and toughness.
* Produce a specific microstructure.

The annealing process generally involves three stages:

1.  **Heating:** Raising the metal to a specific, desired temperature.
2.  **Holding (Soaking):** Maintaining the metal at this temperature for a sufficient duration to allow for the necessary transformations to occur throughout the material. The time required depends on the size and geometry of the workpiece.
3.  **Cooling:** Gradually reducing the temperature, usually back to room temperature. The cooling rate is critical to prevent the introduction of new internal stresses that could lead to warping or cracking. Faster heating and cooling rates can create temperature gradients within the material.

##### Stress Relief Annealing:

This type of annealing is performed to relieve internal residual stresses that may have developed due to:

* **Plastic deformation processes:** Such as machining, grinding, or cold working.
* **Non-uniform cooling:** Occurring after processing or fabrication at high temperatures, like in welding or casting.
* **Phase transformations:** Where parent and product phases have different densities upon cooling (e.g., martensite formation).

The primary benefit of stress relief annealing is preventing distortion and warpage in the metal component. It is carried out at relatively lower temperatures, ensuring that the existing physical microstructure and the effects of previous cold working or heat treatments are not significantly altered.

##### Process Annealing

Process annealing is conducted below the eutectoid temperature (for ferrous alloys) but above the recrystallization temperature of the metal. Its main purpose is to counteract the effects of cold working, which increases the hardness and reduces the ductility of the metal (strain hardening). This is achieved by allowing recovery and recrystallization processes to occur within the metal's microstructure.

Key benefits and applications of process annealing include:

* **Increased ductility and softness:** Making the metal easier to work with.
* **Enabling further deformation:** It is commonly employed during fabrication procedures that involve extensive plastic deformation, allowing the process to continue without fracture or requiring excessive energy. A fine-grained microstructure is typically desired after process annealing.
* **Prevention of surface oxidation (scaling):** Can be minimized by using relatively lower annealing temperatures or by performing the annealing in a nonoxidizing atmosphere.

### Normalizing:

**Goal:** To refine the grain structure of plastically deformed steel, resulting in a more uniform and desirable fine-grained pearlite (and proeutectoid phase) microstructure. This process aims to "normalize" the grain size and improve toughness compared to coarse-grained structures, as well as produce a more reproducible microstructure.

**Process:**

1.  **Austenitizing:** The steel is heated to a temperature approximately 55°C (100°F) above the upper critical temperature line on the iron-iron carbide phase diagram (Figure 11.14):
    * Above A3 for hypoeutectoid compositions (less than 0.76 wt% C).
    * Above Acm for hypereutectoid compositions (greater than 0.76 wt% C).
    This heating ensures that the steel transforms completely into the austenite phase.

2.  **Cooling:** The steel is then cooled in still air. This air cooling results in a relatively faster cooling rate compared to furnace cooling, leading to the formation of finer pearlite and the proeutectoid phase (ferrite or cementite, depending on the steel composition).

#### Full Anneal:

**Goal:** To produce a very soft and ductile steel that is well-suited for machining or extensive plastic deformation during forming operations. This process typically results in a microstructure of coarse pearlite and the proeutectoid phase.

**Process:**

1.  **Heating:** The steel is heated to a temperature approximately 50°C (90°F) above the critical temperatures on the iron-iron carbide phase diagram (Figure 11.14):
    * For hypoeutectoid steels (low- and medium-carbon): Above the A3 line to fully transform to austenite.
    * For hypereutectoid steels: Above the A1 line (eutectoid temperature) to form austenite and cementite phases.

2.  **Furnace Cooling:** The key characteristic of full annealing is slow cooling within the furnace. After holding at the austenitizing temperature for a sufficient time, the furnace power is turned off, and both the furnace and the steel cool down to room temperature at the same rate over several hours. This slow cooling promotes the formation of coarse pearlite, which is softer and more ductile than fine pearlite.

#### Spheroidizing:

**Goal:** To achieve maximum softness and ductility in medium- and high-carbon steels, making them easier to machine or plastically deform. This is accomplished by transforming the microstructure, where the lamellar (layered) cementite (Fe3C) in pearlite is converted into spheroid (spherical or globular) particles within a ferrite matrix (spheroidite).

**Process:** There are several methods to achieve spheroidizing:

* **Prolonged Heating Just Below A1:** Heating the alloy at a temperature slightly below the eutectoid temperature (approximately 700°C or 1300°F) in the ferrite (α) + cementite (Fe3C) region for an extended period (typically 15-25 hours, longer for coarser initial pearlite). This allows the cementite to gradually coalesce into spheroids.

* **Heating Above A1 and Slow Cooling or Holding Below A1:** Heating to a temperature just above the eutectoid temperature (A1), followed by either very slow cooling in the furnace or holding the temperature just below A1 for a certain duration.

* **Cyclic Heating Around A1:** Heating and cooling the steel alternately within a temperature range of about ± 50°C of the A1 line.

The rate of spheroidite formation depends on the initial microstructure (faster for finer pearlite and with prior cold work).

### Heat Treatment for Forming Martensitic Steels

The primary goal of heat treating steels to form martensite is to achieve an optimal combination of mechanical properties after subsequent tempering. A high content of martensite before tempering is desired because the formation of pearlite and/or bainite can compromise the final properties. The ability to obtain a predominantly martensitic microstructure throughout a steel part depends on three main factors: alloy composition, the quenching medium, and the size and shape of the specimen.

##### Alloy Composition

###### Hardenability and the Jominy End-Quench Test:

**Hardenability** is a measure of a steel alloy's ability to be hardened by forming martensite as a result of a specific heat treatment. It's crucial to understand that hardenability is *not* the same as *hardness*. Hardness is the resistance to indentation, while hardenability is a qualitative measure of how deep into the interior of a specimen a certain hardness level (indicating martensite formation) can be achieved with a given quench. A steel with high hardenability forms martensite not just at the surface but also to a significant extent throughout its interior.

The **Jominy end-quench test** is a standard laboratory procedure used to determine the hardenability of a steel alloy. This test keeps specimen size, shape, and quenching conditions constant to isolate the effect of alloy composition on hardening depth.

**Jominy End-Quench Test Procedure:**

1.  A cylindrical specimen of specific dimensions (25.4 mm or 1.0 inch in diameter and 100 mm or 4 inches long) is austenitized at a prescribed temperature for a specific time.

2.  The specimen is then rapidly removed from the furnace and mounted vertically in a fixture.

3.  The lower end of the specimen is quenched by a jet of water at a controlled flow rate and temperature (approximately 24°C or 75°F). This creates a gradient in cooling rates along the length of the specimen, with the quenched end cooling most rapidly.

4.  After the specimen cools to room temperature, two shallow flats (0.4 mm or 0.015 inches deep) are ground along its length.

5.  Rockwell C hardness measurements are taken along these flats, starting from the quenched end, at specific intervals (1.6 mm or 1/16 inch for the first 12.8 mm or 1/2 inch, and then every 3.2 mm or 1/8 inch up to 50 mm or 2 inches).

###### Hardenability Curves:

A **hardenability curve** is generated by plotting the measured Rockwell C hardness values as a function of the distance from the quenched end of the Jominy specimen.

* The quenched end, with the fastest cooling rate, typically exhibits the maximum hardness, corresponding to 100% martensite formation for most steels.
* As the distance from the quenched end increases, the cooling rate decreases, allowing more time for carbon diffusion and the formation of softer phases like pearlite (and sometimes bainite), leading to a decrease in hardness.
* Steels with higher hardenability show a more gradual decrease in hardness with increasing Jominy distance.
* Each steel alloy has a unique hardenability curve.
* Hardenability curves are influenced by **carbon content**: Higher carbon content generally leads to higher hardness at any given Jominy distance.
* **Alloying elements** like nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), and molybdenum (Mo) significantly increase hardenability by delaying the transformation of austenite to pearlite and/or bainite, allowing more martensite to form at slower cooling rates. This results in a flatter hardenability curve where high hardness values are retained over longer Jominy distances.
* Due to slight variations in composition and grain size between steel batches, hardenability data is often presented as a **hardenability band** showing the expected range of hardness values for a particular alloy. Steels designated with an "H" (e.g., 8640H) have a guaranteed hardenability within a specified band.

##### Quenching Medium

The **severity of the quench** refers to the rate of cooling achieved by the quenching medium. A more rapid cooling rate is considered a more severe quench. The common quenching media in order of decreasing severity are:

* **Water:** Provides the most rapid cooling rate among common media.
* **Oil:** Offers a moderate cooling rate, less severe than water. Often preferred for higher-carbon steels to minimize cracking and warping.
* **Air:** Results in a slow cooling rate. Typically produces a predominantly pearlitic structure in plain carbon steels.
* **Furnace:** Represents the slowest cooling rate, used in full annealing.

**Agitation** of the quenching medium significantly increases the severity of the quench by improving heat transfer away from the specimen surface.

##### Size and Shape of Specimen

During quenching, heat energy from the steel specimen must be conducted to its surface and then dissipated into the quenching medium. Therefore:

* **Bar Diameter (Size):** The cooling rate at different points within a specimen varies with its size. Larger diameter bars cool more slowly in their interior compared to their surface. This leads to variations in microstructure and hardness across the cross-section. The provided text includes diagrams (Figure 11.21) showing the relationship between cooling rate, bar diameter, and equivalent Jominy distance for water and oil quenches.
* **Surface Area to Mass Ratio (Shape):** The rate of cooling for a given quenching treatment is also influenced by the specimen's shape, specifically the ratio of its surface area to its mass. A higher surface area to mass ratio allows for faster heat dissipation and thus a more rapid cooling rate.
    * Irregular shapes with sharp edges and corners tend to have higher surface-to-mass ratios and are more easily hardened by quenching than regular, rounded shapes like spheres and cylinders of the same volume.

For applications involving relatively high stresses, it is often required to achieve a minimum of 80% martensite throughout the interior of the quenched part. For moderately stressed parts, a minimum of 50% martensite might be sufficient. Hardenability curves, in conjunction with data on cooling rates for different quenching media and specimen geometries, are essential tools for selecting the appropriate steel alloy and quenching procedure for a specific application.

### Precipitation Hardening

Precipitation hardening, also known as age hardening, is a heat treatment process used to enhance the strength and hardness of certain metal alloys. This is achieved through the formation of extremely small, uniformly dispersed particles of a second phase (called precipitates) within the original phase matrix. These precipitates hinder the movement of dislocations, which are defects in the crystal structure that allow metals to deform easily.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Mechanism:** The strength increase occurs over time as the alloy "ages" at a specific temperature, allowing the precipitates to form and grow.
* **Examples of Alloys:** Aluminum-copper, copper-beryllium, copper-tin, and magnesium-aluminum alloys are common examples of precipitation-hardenable alloys. Some ferrous alloys can also undergo this process.
* **Distinction from Tempering Martensite:** While both involve heat treatments, precipitation hardening and the tempering of martensitic steel are fundamentally different processes with distinct mechanisms for strengthening.

**Requirements for Precipitation Hardening:**

The alloy system's phase diagram must exhibit specific characteristics:

* **Appreciable Maximum Solubility:** One component must have a relatively high solubility in the other at an elevated temperature (typically several percent).
* **Decreasing Solubility with Temperature:** The solubility limit of the solute component in the solvent component must rapidly decrease as the temperature is lowered.
* **Alloy Composition:** The overall composition of the alloy must be less than the maximum solubility limit.
* **Lattice Distortion:** The formation of precipitates must create lattice strain at the interface between the precipitate and the matrix. This distortion impedes dislocation motion.

**Heat Treatment Procedure:**

Precipitation hardening involves two main heat treatment stages (as illustrated in Figure 11.27):

1.  **Solution Heat Treatment:**
    * The alloy is heated to a temperature within the single-phase region (e.g., the α phase in Figure 11.26), where all solute atoms dissolve to form a homogeneous solid solution.
    * The alloy is held at this temperature long enough to ensure complete dissolution of any existing second-phase particles.
    * The alloy is then rapidly cooled or quenched (e.g., to room temperature). This rapid cooling prevents the formation of the equilibrium precipitate phase, resulting in a supersaturated solid solution where the solvent phase (e.g., α) contains more solute atoms (e.g., B) than it would under equilibrium conditions at the lower temperature. In this state, the alloy is relatively soft and weak.

2.  **Precipitation Heat Treatment (Aging):**
    * The supersaturated solid solution is reheated to an intermediate temperature within the two-phase region (e.g., α + β in Figure 11.26), where the equilibrium precipitate phase (e.g., β) is stable. This temperature is typically lower than the solution heat treatment temperature.
    * The alloy is held at this temperature for a specific time, allowing the solute atoms to diffuse and form finely dispersed particles (precipitates) of the second phase. This process is often referred to as aging.
    * The size and distribution of these precipitate particles are critical for achieving maximum strength and hardness.
    * Finally, the alloy is cooled to room temperature. The cooling rate after precipitation heat treatment is usually not as critical as the quenching after solution treatment.

**Underaging and Overaging:**

The strength and hardness of a precipitation-hardened alloy change with the aging time at a constant temperature (as shown in Figure 11.28):

* **Underaging:** If the aging time is too short, the precipitates are very small and not optimally dispersed to effectively hinder dislocation movement. The alloy has not yet reached its maximum strength.

* **Optimal Aging:** There is an optimal aging time and temperature where the size and distribution of the precipitates are ideal for maximizing strength and hardness.

* **Overaging:** If the aging time is too long, the precipitate particles grow too large and become more widely spaced. Larger precipitates are less effective at blocking dislocations, leading to a decrease in strength and hardness (the alloy becomes softer and weaker).

The key to successful precipitation hardening is controlling the aging time and temperature to achieve the desired size and distribution of precipitates for maximum strengthening.

### Natural Aging

Natural aging refers to precipitation hardening that occurs spontaneously at ambient (room) temperature over an extended period. Some alloys, particularly certain aluminum alloys used for rivets, exhibit this behavior. These rivets are often used shortly after solution heat treatment when they are still soft and ductile, and then they naturally age harden to achieve the required strength in the assembled structure.

### Artificial Aging

Artificial aging involves precipitation hardening carried out at elevated temperatures (above room temperature) in a furnace or other heating device. This accelerates the diffusion and precipitation processes, allowing the desired strength and hardness to be achieved in a shorter time compared to natural aging. This method is commonly used for alloys intended for service at higher temperatures or when faster processing times are needed. For example, it can be important for applications requiring resistance to creep (time-dependent deformation under constant load) at elevated temperatures.
