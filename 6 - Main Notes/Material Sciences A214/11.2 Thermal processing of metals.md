# 11.2 Thermal processing of metals

#### Why should we care about thermal processing?
- Needed to 
	- Relieve residual stresses ( for example from welding)
	- increase softness/ductility/toughness for other processes such as machining/forming
	- produce a specific microstructure. For Example
		- Combination of strength and ductility
		- Higher strength metals for high stress applications ( for example, precipitation hardening)

#### Annealing
	Heat Treatment applied to a metal to achieve a set of properties

##### Stress relief annealing:
Relieves internal stresses from:
	Plastic deformation process such as grinding/ machining
	non-uniform cooling(welding/casting)
	phase transformations(such as from martensite forming)
prevents warping/distortion
does not affect physical microstructure - lower temperatures

##### Process annealing
Below eutectoid but above recrystallisation temperature
counters the effects of cold working
increases ductility through recovery and recrystallisation
used for high plastic deformation fabrication operations

### Normalizing:
Goals; refine and "normalize" grains of plastically deformed steel.
Austenitizing 55 deg C above the upper critical temperatures.(A3 and Acm)
cooling in air: fine pearlite and proeutectoid phase.
Improves toughness and produces reproducible microstructure.

#### Full anneal:
Goal: prepares a steel for machining or forming
low and medium carbon steels
hypoeutectoid: 50 deg C above A3
hypereutectoid: 50 deg C above A1
Furnace cool: coarse pearlite and proeutectoid phase.

#### Spheroidizing 
Medium to high carbon steels.
Several methods:
	Just below A1 at 700( longer times for coarse pearlite
	just above A1 followed by slow cooling/holding at temperatures just below A1
	heating and cooling within 50 deg of A1
Goal: enhance ductility/ maximise softness for machining
decomposition of lamellar Fe3C into spheroid particles

### Heat treatment of steels
Better to be relabelled as "Heat treatment to form martensitic steels"
Maximum amount of martensite formed: to optimize properties through tempering

##### Alloy composition

##### Quenching medium

##### Size and shape of specimen
