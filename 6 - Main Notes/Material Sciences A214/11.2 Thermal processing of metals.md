# 11.2 Thermal processing of metals

#### Why should we care about thermal processing?
- Needed to 
	- Relieve residual stresses ( for example from welding)
	- increase softness/ductility/toughness for other processes such as machining/forming
	- produce a specific microstructure. For Example
		- Combination of strength and ductility
		- Higher strength metals for high stress applications ( for example, precipitation hardening)

#### Annealing

Annealing is a crucial heat treatment applied to metals to achieve a desired set of properties by heating the material to an elevated temperature for an extended period, followed by slow cooling. The main goals of annealing are to:

* Relieve internal stresses.
* Increase softness, ductility, and toughness.
* Produce a specific microstructure.

The annealing process generally involves three stages:

1.  **Heating:** Raising the metal to a specific, desired temperature.
2.  **Holding (Soaking):** Maintaining the metal at this temperature for a sufficient duration to allow for the necessary transformations to occur throughout the material. The time required depends on the size and geometry of the workpiece.
3.  **Cooling:** Gradually reducing the temperature, usually back to room temperature. The cooling rate is critical to prevent the introduction of new internal stresses that could lead to warping or cracking. Faster heating and cooling rates can create temperature gradients within the material.

##### Stress Relief Annealing:

This type of annealing is performed to relieve internal residual stresses that may have developed due to:

* **Plastic deformation processes:** Such as machining, grinding, or cold working.
* **Non-uniform cooling:** Occurring after processing or fabrication at high temperatures, like in welding or casting.
* **Phase transformations:** Where parent and product phases have different densities upon cooling (e.g., martensite formation).

The primary benefit of stress relief annealing is preventing distortion and warpage in the metal component. It is carried out at relatively lower temperatures, ensuring that the existing physical microstructure and the effects of previous cold working or heat treatments are not significantly altered.

##### Process Annealing

Process annealing is conducted below the eutectoid temperature (for ferrous alloys) but above the recrystallization temperature of the metal. Its main purpose is to counteract the effects of cold working, which increases the hardness and reduces the ductility of the metal (strain hardening). This is achieved by allowing recovery and recrystallization processes to occur within the metal's microstructure.

Key benefits and applications of process annealing include:

* **Increased ductility and softness:** Making the metal easier to work with.
* **Enabling further deformation:** It is commonly employed during fabrication procedures that involve extensive plastic deformation, allowing the process to continue without fracture or requiring excessive energy. A fine-grained microstructure is typically desired after process annealing.
* **Prevention of surface oxidation (scaling):** Can be minimized by using relatively lower annealing temperatures or by performing the annealing in a nonoxidizing atmosphere.

### Normalizing:

**Goal:** To refine the grain structure of plastically deformed steel, resulting in a more uniform and desirable fine-grained pearlite (and proeutectoid phase) microstructure. This process aims to "normalize" the grain size and improve toughness compared to coarse-grained structures, as well as produce a more reproducible microstructure.

**Process:**

1.  **Austenitizing:** The steel is heated to a temperature approximately 55°C (100°F) above the upper critical temperature line on the iron-iron carbide phase diagram (Figure 11.14):
    * Above A3 for hypoeutectoid compositions (less than 0.76 wt% C).
    * Above Acm for hypereutectoid compositions (greater than 0.76 wt% C).
    This heating ensures that the steel transforms completely into the austenite phase.

2.  **Cooling:** The steel is then cooled in still air. This air cooling results in a relatively faster cooling rate compared to furnace cooling, leading to the formation of finer pearlite and the proeutectoid phase (ferrite or cementite, depending on the steel composition).

#### Full Anneal:

**Goal:** To produce a very soft and ductile steel that is well-suited for machining or extensive plastic deformation during forming operations. This process typically results in a microstructure of coarse pearlite and the proeutectoid phase.

**Process:**

1.  **Heating:** The steel is heated to a temperature approximately 50°C (90°F) above the critical temperatures on the iron-iron carbide phase diagram (Figure 11.14):
    * For hypoeutectoid steels (low- and medium-carbon): Above the A3 line to fully transform to austenite.
    * For hypereutectoid steels: Above the A1 line (eutectoid temperature) to form austenite and cementite phases.

2.  **Furnace Cooling:** The key characteristic of full annealing is slow cooling within the furnace. After holding at the austenitizing temperature for a sufficient time, the furnace power is turned off, and both the furnace and the steel cool down to room temperature at the same rate over several hours. This slow cooling promotes the formation of coarse pearlite, which is softer and more ductile than fine pearlite.

#### Spheroidizing:

**Goal:** To achieve maximum softness and ductility in medium- and high-carbon steels, making them easier to machine or plastically deform. This is accomplished by transforming the microstructure, where the lamellar (layered) cementite (Fe3C) in pearlite is converted into spheroid (spherical or globular) particles within a ferrite matrix (spheroidite).

**Process:** There are several methods to achieve spheroidizing:

* **Prolonged Heating Just Below A1:** Heating the alloy at a temperature slightly below the eutectoid temperature (approximately 700°C or 1300°F) in the ferrite (α) + cementite (Fe3C) region for an extended period (typically 15-25 hours, longer for coarser initial pearlite). This allows the cementite to gradually coalesce into spheroids.

* **Heating Above A1 and Slow Cooling or Holding Below A1:** Heating to a temperature just above the eutectoid temperature (A1), followed by either very slow cooling in the furnace or holding the temperature just below A1 for a certain duration.

* **Cyclic Heating Around A1:** Heating and cooling the steel alternately within a temperature range of about ± 50°C of the A1 line.

The rate of spheroidite formation depends on the initial microstructure (faster for finer pearlite and with prior cold work).

Over aging and under aging

Precipitation hardening, also known as age hardening, is a heat treatment process used to strengthen alloys. During this process, the material undergoes aging, where precipitates form and impede dislocation movement, increasing strength.

- **Underaging** occurs when the aging process is stopped too early. The precipitates are small and not fully developed, which means they cannot effectively block dislocations. As a result, the material does not achieve its maximum strength.
    
- **Overaging** happens when the aging process continues for too long. The precipitates grow too large and become less effective at blocking dislocations. This leads to a decrease in strength and hardness.
    

The key is to find the optimal aging time to maximize the material's properties.
