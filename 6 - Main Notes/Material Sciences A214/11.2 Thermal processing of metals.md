# 11.2 Thermal processing of metals

#### Why should we care about thermal processing?
- Needed to 
	- Relieve residual stresses ( for example from welding)
	- increase softness/ductility/toughness for other processes such as machining/forming
	- produce a specific microstructure. For Example
		- Combination of strength and ductility
		- Higher strength metals for high stress applications ( for example, precipitation hardening)

#### Annealing
	Heat Treatment applied to a metal to achieve a set of properties

##### Stress relief annealing:
Relieves internal stresses from:
	Plastic deformation process such as grinding/ machining
	non-uniform cooling(welding/casting)
	phase transformations(such as from martensite forming)
prevents warping/distortion
does not affect physical microstructure - lower temperatures

##### Process annealing
Below eutectoid but above recrystallisation temperature
counters the effects of cold working
increases ductility through recovery and recrystallisation
used for high plastic deformation fabrication operations

### Normalizing:
Goals; refine and "normalize" grains of plastically deformed steel.
Austenitizing 55 deg C above the upper critical temperatures.(A3 and Acm)
cooling in air: fine pearlite and proeutectoid phase.
Improves toughness and produces reproducible microstructure.

#### Full anneal:
Goal: prepares a steel for machining or forming
low and medium carbon steels
hypoeutectoid: 50 deg C above A3
hypereutectoid: 50 deg C above A1
Furnace cool: coarse pearlite and proeutectoid phase.

#### Spheroidizing 
Medium to high carbon steels.
Several methods:
	Just below A1 at 700( longer times for coarse pearlite
	just above A1 followed by slow cooling/holding at temperatures just below A1
	heating and cooling within 50 deg of A1
Goal: enhance ductility/ maximise softness for machining
decomposition of lamellar Fe3C into spheroid particles

### Heat treatment of steels
Better to be relabelled as "Heat treatment to form martensitic steels"
Maximum amount of martensite formed: to optimize properties through tempering





##### Alloy composition

###### Hardenability: jominy end-quench test
Ability of alloy steel to transform to martensite( be hardened ) for a particular quenching treatment
Jominy end Quench test: measures how hardness changes along specimen length

Hardenability curves:
Higher hardenability for higher carbon content
##### Quenching medium
Severity of quench: rate of cooling
Water:
	rel rapid
Oil:
	rel moderate
Air:
	rel slow
Furnace
	slowest
More Agitation: increase quenching severity

##### Size and shape of specimen

heat energy conducted to surface and dissipated.
Influence of bar diameter

surface area to mass ratio
	Plates > squares > cylinders
	the higher the surface area to mass ratio the quicker it will cool/ the greater the hardness profile

### Precipitation hardening
Strengthening and hardening of metal alloys through formation of small, uniformly dispersed particles (precipitates)
Age hardening
Example : aluminium-copper binary system

requirements:
	rel large solubility limit of one component
	solubility that rapidly decrease with temperature 
	composition less than maximum solubility limit
	Specific heat treatment:
		Solution heat treatment
		Precipitation heat treatment
	Lattice distortion at precipitate-matrix boundary


Over aging and under aging

Precipitation hardening, also known as age hardening, is a heat treatment process used to strengthen alloys. During this process, the material undergoes aging, where precipitates form and impede dislocation movement, increasing strength.

- **Underaging** occurs when the aging process is stopped too early. The precipitates are small and not fully developed, which means they cannot effectively block dislocations. As a result, the material does not achieve its maximum strength.
    
- **Overaging** happens when the aging process continues for too long. The precipitates grow too large and become less effective at blocking dislocations. This leads to a decrease in strength and hardness.
    

The key is to find the optimal aging time to maximize the material's properties.

### Natural aging
Precipitation hardening that occurs at ambient conditions - rivets

### Artificial Aging
Precipitation hardening that occurs at elevated temperature conditions - for e.g. creep
