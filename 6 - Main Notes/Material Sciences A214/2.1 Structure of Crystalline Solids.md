# 2.1 Structure of Crystalline Solids

A solid materials category depends on its atomic bonding

We only look at Cubic and Hexagonal Crystal structures

### Types
[[BCC]] - a = 4R/root3
	One 8th atom at each corner and then a full atom in the middle
[[FCC]] - a = 2R(root2)
	one 8th atom at each corner then half atom at each face
[[HCP]]
	Hexagonal shape, 1/6 atoms at each corner and then one half in the middle; both top and bottom and then in the middle it's the same as the top/bottom but shifted over so it fits ( 3 whole atoms in the middle)

## FCC calculations ( Atomic packing factor)
![[Pasted image 20250316100246.png]]
74% of volume is atom mass, 26% is empty space
Coordination number = how many atoms each atom touches ( can start with any atom = 12 in FCC)

## BCC calculations 
![[Pasted image 20250316100557.png]]
68% col of unit cell is mass and 22% is empty space

Coordination number of 8 (  easy to look at center atom)

## HCP calculations
![[Pasted image 20250316100744.png]]
Has same packing factor as FCC

### Ceramic Crystal Structures

##### [[Ceramic]] Bonding
Mostly ionic bonds
	ionic bonds need charge neutrality
	relative size of atoms needs to ensure all atoms remain in contact with one another 
	
Ceramics have a range of bonds that range from totally ionic to totally covalent, due to their complex structure the degree of ionic character is dependent on the electronegativity of the atoms.
##### [[Crystal Structures]] 
For ceramics which bonds are predominantly ionic can be tough as electrically charged ions are used instead of atoms. Metallic ions or [[Cations]](+) are positively charged; non-metallic ions  or [[anions]](-) are negatively charged.

both magnitude of charge and relative size affect the crystal structure of a ceramic.
1. The [[crystal structure]] must be electrically neutral - all positive charged must be balanced by the negative ones.
2. rc and ra (radius of cation and anion respectively) - rc/ra is less than unity - Each cation prefers to have as many nearest-neighbor anions as possible. The anions also desire a maximum number of cation nearest neighbors. As viewed below: ![[Pasted image 20250316101346.png]]
Different ratios will cause for different structures. As viewed below:![[Pasted image 20250316115023.png]]

###### AX-type crystal structures
some common ceramic materials are ones with equal anions and cations. These are referred to as AX compounds, A denotes cation and X denotes anion
	Rock Salt Structure : 
		Most common AX crystal structure - sodium chloride(NaCl)/ rock salt coordination number for both cat and anion is 6 therefore cation-anion radius ratio is 0.141 and 0.732
		A unit cell for this crystal structure is generated from an FCC arrangement of anions with one cation situated at the cube center and one at the center of each 12 cube edges. 
	Cesium Chloride Structure:
		the co- ordination number is 8 for both ion types. The anions are located at each of the corners of a cube, whereas the cube center is a single cation. Interchange of anions with cations, and vice versa, produces the same crystal structure. This is not a BCC crystal structure because ions of two different kinds are involved.
	Zinc Blende Structure:
		A third AX structure is one in which the coordination number is 4—that is, all ions are tetrahedrally coordinated. This is called the zinc blende, or sphalerite, structure, after the mineralogical term for zinc sulfide (ZnS). A unit cell is presented in Figure 12.4; all corner and face positions of the cubic cell are occupied by S atoms, whereas the Zn atoms fill interior tetrahedral positions. An equivalent structure results if Zn and S atom positions are reversed. Thus, each Zn atom is bonded to four S atoms, and vice versa. Most often the atomic bonding is highly covalent in compounds exhibiting this crystal structure (Table 12.1), which include ZnS, ZnTe, and SiC.

###### AmXp-type Crystal structures
When the charges of Cations and anions are not the same.
	 a compound can exist with the chemical formula AmXp, where m and/or p ≠ 1. An example is AX2, for which a common crystal structure is found in fluorite (CaF2). The ionic radii ratio rC /rA for CaF2 is about 0.8, which, according to Table 12.2, gives a coordination number of 8. Calcium ions are positioned at the centers of cubes, with fluorine ions at the corners. The chemical formula shows that there are only half as many Ca2+ ions as F− ions, and therefore the crystal structure is similar to CsCl (Figure 12.3), except that only half the center cube positions are occupied by Ca2+ ions. One unit cell consists of eight cubes, as indicated in Figure 12.5. Other compounds with this crystal structure include ZrO2 (cubic), UO2, PuO2, and ThO2.
###### AmBnXp - Type crystal Structures
it is also possible for ceramic compounds to have more then one type of cation; for two types of cations.
	Chemical Formula designated as AmBnXp. 

### Crystal Structures from the Close packing on anions
1. **Close-Packed Planes**: Metals form FCC (Face-Centered Cubic) or HCP (Hexagonal Close-Packed) structures. Similarly, ceramics have close-packed planes of large anions, with smaller cations occupying interstitial sites (tetrahedral and octahedral positions).
    
2. **Interstitial Positions**:
    
    - **Tetrahedral positions**: Surrounded by 4 atoms, coordination number = 4.
        
    - **Octahedral positions**: Surrounded by 6 atoms, coordination number = 6.
        
    - Each anion has one octahedral and two tetrahedral sites.
        
3. **Ceramic Structures**: Depend on:
    
    - **Anion stacking** (FCC or HCP patterns).
        
    - **Cation filling of interstitial sites**.
        
4. **Rock Salt Structure**: Features cubic symmetry with an FCC array of anions. Cations occupy all octahedral positions, with a 1:1 cation-to-anion ratio.
    
5. **Examples of Ceramic Structures**:
    
    - Rock Salt (NaCl): FCC, coordination number 6 for both cations and anions.
        
    - Cesium Chloride (CsCl): Simple cubic, coordination number 8.
        
    - Zinc Blende (ZnS): FCC, coordination number 4.
        
    - Fluorite (CaF₂): Simple cubic, coordination number 8 for cations and 4 for anions.
        
    - Perovskite (BaTiO₃): FCC, with varying coordination numbers.
        
    - Spinel (MgAl₂O₄): FCC, with both tetrahedral and octahedral cations.
        

In summary, ceramic crystal structures are defined by the stacking of anion planes and how cations occupy interstitial sites, leading to varied arrangements and coordination numbers.

### Ceramic Density Computations
It is possible to compute the theoretical density of a crystalline ceramic material from unit cell data in a manner similar to one previously described.
![[Pasted image 20250316122709.png]]
	Where 
		n' = number of formula units within the unit cell
		sigmaAc = the sum of atomic weights of all cations  in the fomula unit
		sigmaAa = the sum of the atomic weights of all anions in the fomula unit
		Vc = the unit cell volume
		Na = Avogadro's number


### Silicate Ceramics
**Silicates:**

- Composed of silicon (Si) and oxygen (O), they are the most abundant materials in Earth's crust, including soils, rocks, clays, and sand.
    
- The fundamental building block is the SiO₄⁴⁻ tetrahedron, where a central silicon atom bonds covalently to four oxygen atoms.
    
- Silicates show significant covalent bonding, but due to formal charges, SiO₄⁴⁻ is often treated as a negatively charged unit.
    
- Various silicate structures (one-, two-, and three-dimensional) form based on how these tetrahedra are combined.
    

**Silica (SiO₂):**

- The simplest silicate, consisting of a three-dimensional network of SiO₄⁴⁻ tetrahedra with shared oxygen atoms.
    
- Exists in polymorphic crystalline forms (quartz, cristobalite, tridymite) with relatively open, low-density structures and a high melting point (1710°C or 3110°F).
    
- Silica also exists as fused or vitreous silica (noncrystalline) with a disordered atomic structure. Other oxides, called network formers, can create similar noncrystalline structures.
    

**Silica Glasses:**

- Created by adding oxides like CaO and Na₂O, which act as network modifiers to alter the SiO₄⁴⁻ network.
    
- Oxides like TiO₂ and Al₂O₃ are called intermediates since they integrate into the silica network, stabilizing it and lowering the melting point and viscosity, making the glass easier to form.
    

**Silicates (Complex Structures):**

- Sharing corner oxygen atoms leads to complex arrangements, such as:
    
    - Isolated tetrahedra (e.g., forsterite, Mg₂SiO₄).
        
    - Single and double chains (e.g., akermanite, Ca₂MgSi₂O₇).
        
    - Two-dimensional sheets and three-dimensional frameworks.
        
- Cations like Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, and Al³⁺ balance charges and bond tetrahedra together.
    

**Layered Silicates:**

- Formed by sharing three oxygen atoms in tetrahedra to create two-dimensional sheets (e.g., Si₂O₅²⁻ units).
    
- Clays like kaolinite have adjacent layers (silica and aluminum hydroxide layers) bonded by van der Waals forces, forming flat plate-like crystals.
    
- Other examples include talc and micas, which are raw materials for ceramics.
    

**Concepts that Might Need More Clarity:**

1. **SiO₄⁴⁻ Tetrahedron’s Charge:** It may be helpful to explain how the formal charge of -4 arises from the shared oxygen atoms and how cations compensate for this to ensure neutrality.
    
2. **Polymorphism of Silica:** The concept of crystalline forms (quartz, cristobalite, tridymite) could be elaborated on, particularly why these structures differ and their implications.
    
3. **Network Modifiers and Intermediates:** Their roles in lowering viscosity and adjusting the melting point might need more practical examples for clarity.

### Carbon Crystal Structures
allotropes are diamonds and graphite


### Polymer Crystallinity
-  most [[Polymers]] are either [[amorphous]] or only [[partially crystalline]], i.e. [[semicrystalline]] : crystalline regions dispersed  within the remaining amorphous material
- Degree of [[crystallinity]] is directly proportional to density - amorphous regions are less dense
- linear polymers ten to be semi-crystalline, decreases with branching , crosslinking and networking. Most network polymers are amorphous

### Density Computations
density:
	![[Pasted image 20250316110600.png]]
	where
		n = number of atoms associated with each unit cell
		A = atomic weight
		Vc = volume of the unit cell
		Na = Avogadro's number ( 6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol)
#### linear Planar Density
- **Equivalency in Directions and Planes:**
    
    - Equivalent crystallographic directions share the same **linear density (LD)**.
        
    - Equivalent planes have identical **planar density (PD)**.
        
- **Linear Density (LD):**
    
    - Measures the number of atoms per unit length along a specific crystallographic direction.
        
    - Formula: **LD = (number of atoms along the direction) / (length of the direction vector)**.
        
    - Example: For the [110] direction in an FCC (Face-Centered Cubic) structure:
        
        - The total number of atoms on the [110] direction is 2 (accounting for shared atoms across unit cells).
            
        - The length of the direction vector is **4R** (where R is the atomic radius).
            
        - LD = 2 atoms / 4R = **1 / 2R**.
            
- **Planar Density (PD):**
    
    - Measures the number of atoms per unit area on a specific crystallographic plane.
        
    - Formula: **PD = (number of atoms centered on the plane) / (area of the plane)**.
        
    - Example: For the (110) plane in an FCC structure:
        
        - The total number of atoms in this plane is 2 (considering fractional contributions of atoms).
            
        - The area of the plane = **8R²√2**.
            
        - PD = 2 atoms / 8R²√2 = **1 / 4R²√2**.
            
- **Importance of Linear and Planar Densities:**
    
    - These densities influence **[[slip systems]]**, which are critical to how metals plastically deform. Slip typically occurs along the most densely packed directions and planes.

### Close packing
Both face-centered cubic (FCC) and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) crystal structures have an atomic packing factor of 0.74, indicating the most efficient packing of atoms. These structures are formed by stacking close-packed planes of atoms in different sequences. FCC follows an ABCABC... stacking pattern, while HCP has an ABABAB... sequence. These arrangements influence their crystalline properties and are also relevant to ceramics and polymers.

### Polymorphism and allotropy
some metals as well as non metals have more then one crystal structure, a phenomenon known as [[polymorphism]]. When found in elemental solids the condition is often termed [[allotropy]]. the viewed crystal structure depends on external temperature and pressure. e.g. Carbon : graphite is formed at ambient conditions while diamond is formed at extremely high pressures. Iron has BCC at room temp but FCC at 912 degrees Celsius.
Most often a modification of the density and other physical properties accompanies a polymorphic transformation.
