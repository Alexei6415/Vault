# 1.2 Crystallography

### Recap
[[1.1 Introduction to Material Science]]
	All matter made of of atoms
	Number of Protons and neutrons tells us which atom it is
	All atoms surrounded by electrons in a could/orbit
	Structure determines how atoms bond together ([[Atomic Bonding]])
	[[Types of bonds]] - Ionic , Covalent and metallic

[[Crystalline Solid materials.]]
	Crystalline Material Definition: 'A Crystalline material is one in which the atoms are situated in a repeating or periodic array over large atomic distances - that is, long-range order exists, such that upon solidification, the atoms will position themselves in a repetitive three-dimensional pattern, in which each atom us bonded to its nearest neighbor atoms.'

Different Materials assemble their atoms in a different patterns called [[Crystal Structures]]

The three-dimensional space in which atoms are arranged is called the [[Crystal lattice]],
with points in space relating to the position of the atoms.

Crystal structures are made up of characteristic *-unit cells that are repeated throughout the crystal lattice

#### Why its important
1. Type of [[atomic bond]] determines bond strength
2. Type of crystal structure determines long range order of atoms
3. Together the structure and properties of [[crystalline]] material are determined and therefore we can design a material for our engineering needs


### [[Lattice Parameters]]
the crystal lattice is described by an x-y-z coordinate system, where the
angles between the different coordinate directions are given by α - β - γ
The crystal system is defined by unit cell lengths a,b,c along x,y,z as well as
the internal angles.
Therefore the lattice parameters a,b,c and α - β - γ define the crystal system
and unit cell geometry

### Single Crystals vs Polycrystalline materials
When atoms assemble in a periodic manner, without interruption, through out the
specific specimen of a material, a single crystal is formed.

In most cases, there are multiple crystals that form simultaneously and grow
together to forma material made of multiple tiny crystals or [[grains]] - these are
called polycrystalline materials

[[Polycrystalline]] properties:
	Conductivity, along different crystal directions
	Anisotropy ( iso is greek for equal and aniso is unequal, tropy is for direction/turn).

- **Single Crystals**: These crystalline solids have perfect, uninterrupted atomic arrangements throughout. Single crystals occur naturally or can be artificially grown under controlled conditions. They form regular geometric shapes, like gemstones, and are crucial in modern technologies such as electronic microcircuits.
    
- **Polycrystalline Materials**: Most crystalline solids consist of many small grains or crystals. During solidification, grains grow in various orientations, resulting in grain boundaries, where slight atomic mismatches occur. The grain structure can vary under microscopic observation.
    
- **[[Anisotropy]]**: In single crystals, some properties (e.g., elastic modulus, electrical conductivity) vary based on crystallographic direction, a phenomenon called anisotropy. This is more pronounced in structures with low symmetry. Conversely, polycrystalline materials may exhibit isotropic behaviour due to random grain orientations.
    
- **Texture and Applications**: Certain polycrystalline materials, like iron alloys in transformer cores, can have preferential grain orientations ("texture") for improved performance. Magnetic textures reduce energy loss by aligning grains with specific crystallographic directions.


#### Directional Indices
Directional indices in crystallography, often referred to as Miller indices for directions, are a shorthand notation that describes the orientation of a vector (direction) within a crystal lattice. These indices help in identifying specific directions in a crystal structure, which are vital for understanding properties like atomic arrangements, slip systems, and diffraction patterns.

### How to Calculate Directional Indices:

1. **Select Two Points**: Choose the starting and ending points of the desired direction in the crystal lattice.
    
2. **Determine Coordinates**: Write down the coordinates of these two points in terms of the crystal's unit cell dimensions.
    
3. **Subtract Coordinates**: Subtract the coordinates of the starting point from the ending point to get the vector's components.
    
4. **Clear Fractions**: If the components are fractional, multiply through by the least common multiple to eliminate fractions.
    
5. **Enclose in Square Brackets**: Represent the directional indices as integers enclosed in square brackets, e.g., [u v w][u \, v \, w].
    

For example, if a direction vector's components relative to the unit cell are (1, 0.5, 0), you would multiply all components by 2 to get the directional indices [2 1 0][2 \, 1 \, 0].

#### Directions in Hexagonal Crystals
Hexagonal crystals have a special challenge because equivalent directions don't always share the same indices in their standard coordinate system. To fix this, a **four-axis system**, called the **Miller–Bravais coordinate system**, is used.

##### Key Points:

- **Axes Structure**:
    
    - The **basal plane** contains three axes: a1a_1, a2a_2, a3a_3, spaced at **120°** angles.
        
    - The fourth axis, zz, is **perpendicular** to the basal plane.
        
- **Directional Indices**:
    
    - In the four-axis system, directions are written as [uvtw][uvtw], where:
        
        - uu, vv, and tt relate to the three basal plane axes (a1a_1, a2a_2, a3a_3).
            
        - ww corresponds to the **z-axis**.
            

##### Conversion Process:

If you have indices in the **three-axis system** [UVW][UVW], you can convert them to the **four-axis system** [uvtw][uvtw] using these equations:

1. u=1/3 (2U−V)u = \frac{1}{3}(2U - V)
    
2. v=1/3 (2V−U)v = \frac{1}{3}(2V - U)
    
3. t=−(u+v)t = -(u + v)
    
4. w=Ww = W
    

##### Example:

Take the direction [010][010] in the three-axis system:

1. U=0U = 0, V=1V = 1, W=0W = 0.
    
2. Plug into the formulas:
    
    - u=13(2(0)−1)=−13u = \frac{1}{3}(2(0) - 1) = -\frac{1}{3}
        
    - v=13(2(1)−0)=23v = \frac{1}{3}(2(1) - 0) = \frac{2}{3}
        
    - t=−(u+v)=−(−13+23)=−1=1t = -(u + v) = -(-\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3}) = -1 = 1.
        
    - w=0w = 0.
        

Therefore, [010][010] in the three-axis system becomes [1210][1210] in the four-axis system.

### Crystallographic planes
**[[Crystallographic]] Planes and [[Miller Indices]]** In crystal structures, planes are identified using a system called Miller indices (hkl). These indices help describe the orientation of planes within a crystal using a coordinate system based on the unit cell. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to determine Miller indices:

1. **Choosing the Origin**: If the plane you're studying passes through the origin, you’ll need to shift the origin to a new position or construct a parallel plane within the unit cell to avoid complications.
    
2. **Finding Intercepts**: The plane will either intersect or run parallel to the x, y, and z axes of the coordinate system. Determine the points where the plane intersects the axes. These intersection points are labelled as A, B, and C.
    
3. **Taking Reciprocals**: Once you have the intercepts (A, B, C), calculate their reciprocals (1/A, 1/B, 1/C). For a plane parallel to an axis, its intercept is infinite, and the reciprocal is zero.
    
4. **Normalizing the Reciprocals**: Multiply these reciprocals by the lattice parameters of the unit cell, labelled as "a," "b," and "c." This step ensures the intercepts are adjusted for the unit cell’s dimensions.
    
5. **Converting to Integers**: If the resulting numbers are fractions, multiply or divide them by a common factor to convert them into the smallest set of whole numbers.
    
6. **Writing the Indices**: Enclose the resulting integers (h, k, l) in parentheses, like this: **(hkl)**. These are the Miller indices that define the orientation of the plane.
    

**Additional Notes**:

- Negative intercepts are indicated with a minus sign or bar above the index.
    
- Reversing all indices (e.g., (hkl) → (-h-k-l)) gives a plane that is parallel but on the opposite side of the origin.
    

For cubic crystals, a neat feature is that planes and directions with the same indices are perpendicular. However, this relationship doesn't hold for non-cubic systems.

### Atomic Arrangements
- **Atomic Arrangements and Crystal Structures**:
    
    - The way atoms are arranged in a crystal affects its properties.
        
    - Crystallographic planes (e.g., the (110) plane) are specific "slices" of the crystal structure that show how atoms are packed.
        
- **FCC vs. BCC Structures**:
    
    - **[[FCC]] (Face-Centered Cubic)**: Atoms are arranged more densely, so planes like (110) in FCC structures have tighter atomic packing.
        
    - **[[BCC]] (Body-Centered Cubic)**: Atoms are less tightly packed compared to FCC, so planes in BCC structures look less crowded.
        
- **Visualizing Planes**:
    
    - Imagine slicing through a cube of atoms—each slice represents a plane.
        
    - Atoms in these planes look like circles when sliced because you're cutting through the middle of the 3D spheres.
        
- **Family of Planes**:
    
    - Crystallographically equivalent planes (planes with similar atomic packing) form a "family" and are grouped together using curly braces, like {100}.
        
    - For cubic crystals, a family like {111} includes all planes with similar indices, regardless of their order or signs (e.g., (111), (1 1 1), etc.).
        
- **Miller Indices (h, k, l)**:
    
    - [[Miller Indices]] describe a crystallographic plane's orientation. They're derived by finding the plane's intersections with the x, y, and z axes.
        
    - Example:
        
        - The (101) plane intersects the x-axis at "a," the z-axis at "c," and is parallel to the y-axis.
            
- **Key Rules for Miller Indices**:
    
    - If **two indices = 0** (e.g., (100)), the plane is parallel to a unit cell face.
        
    - If **one index = 0** (e.g., (110)), the plane forms a parallelogram.
        
    - If **none = 0** (e.g., (111)), the plane intersects all three axes.
        
- **Hexagonal Crystals and the Miller-Bravais System**:
    
    - For hexagonal crystals, an extra index is added (hkil) to ensure all equivalent planes are identified correctly.
        
    - The extra index "i" is derived from h and k using the formula: i=−(h+k)i = -(h + k).
