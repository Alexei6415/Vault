# 4.1 Mechanical Properties of Metals
### Introduction
- **Materials in Service**: Many materials, like aluminium in airplane wings or steel in automobile axles, experience forces or loads. These forces can cause deformation or fractures, so it’s essential to understand the material's characteristics to design components that can withstand such stresses.
    
- **Mechanical Behaviour**: This refers to how materials respond to applied forces. Key properties include:
    
    - **Stiffness**: The ability to resist deformation.
        
    - **Strength**: The maximum stress a material can withstand.
        
    - **Hardness**: Resistance to surface indentation or wear.
        
    - **Ductility**: Ability to deform without breaking.
        
    - **Toughness**: Ability to absorb energy before fracturing.
        
- **Testing Mechanical Properties**: Laboratory experiments simulate service conditions to assess these properties. Factors considered include:
    
    - Nature of the load (tensile, compressive, or shear).
        
    - Load duration (constant or fluctuating).
        
    - Environmental conditions (e.g., temperature).
        
- **Standardization**: Consistency in testing is critical due to diverse interests (manufacturers, researchers, etc.). Professional bodies like the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) set and update standards for mechanical testing techniques.
    
- **Role of Engineers**:
    
    - **Structural Engineers**: Analyse stresses in materials subjected to defined loads using experiments or theoretical approaches.
        
    - **Materials Engineers**: Develop and process materials to meet these service requirements, linking material microstructure to mechanical properties.
        
- **Materials Selection**: Metals, ceramics, and polymers differ significantly in their mechanical behaviour. Metals are discussed here, focusing on stress–strain relationships and other mechanical properties.


## Concepts of Stress and strain
If a load is static or changes slowly over time and is applied uniformly, its mechanical behavior can be analyzed using stress–strain tests, commonly performed on metals at room temperature. Loads are typically applied in three ways: tension, compression, and shear. In engineering, torsional loads (a type of shear) are also common.

### Tension Test
A tension test is a common method to determine the mechanical properties of materials. In this test, a specimen is subjected to a uniaxial tensile load until fracture. Standard specimens, often with a "dogbone" shape, ensure deformation occurs in a narrow, uniform section. During testing, a machine elongates the specimen at a constant rate while measuring the applied load and elongation. The results, which are recorded as load vs. elongation, depend on specimen size. To standardize results, engineering stress (force divided by original cross-sectional area) and engineering strain (elongation relative to original length) are calculated. The test is destructive, permanently deforming or fracturing the specimen.

Load cell measures the load placed on the specimen
Extensometer measures the strain/deformation experienced by the specimen.
we use SANS ISO 6892-I / ASTM
the testing gives us these results
	how much force does it take to deform a metal.
	How much stress can a metal carry before breaking.
	How much energy is stored in the crystal lattice due to it being deformed.
#### [[Elastic deformation]] - metals' [[Crystal lattice]] level
Elastic deformation is reversible, apply the load, bonds stretch, remove the load, bonds snap back into place.
Linear Elastic: deformation , sigma, is linearly related to the load, F


### Compressive Test
Compression stress–strain tests are performed when in-service forces are compressive, making the specimen contract under stress. The test setup is similar to tensile tests, but the force is compressive, resulting in negative stress and strain. Compressive tests are less common because tensile tests are easier and provide sufficient information for most structural materials. However, compressive tests are useful for understanding a material's behaviour under large, permanent (plastic) strains. Equations are employed to calculate the relevant stress and strain values.

### Shear and Torsional Tests
- **Shear Force Tests**:
    
    - Shear stress (𝜏) is calculated as **𝜏 = F / A₀**, where _F_ is the applied force, and _A₀_ is the area of the upper and lower faces.
        
    - Shear strain (𝛾) is defined as the tangent of the strain angle (𝜃).
        
    - Shear stress and strain share the same units as tensile stress and strain.
        
- **Torsion**:
    
    - A variation of shear where a structural member is twisted, creating rotational motion along its axis.
        
    - Common examples include machine axles, drive shafts, and twist drills.
        
    - Torsional tests are typically performed on cylindrical solid shafts or tubes.
        
    - Shear stress (𝜏) depends on applied torque (T), and shear strain (𝛾) relates to the angle of twist (𝜙).


## Stress Strain behaviour
The relationship between stress and strain for metals at low stress levels is proportional, governed by **Hooke’s Law**: σ=Eϵ, where E is the **modulus of elasticity** (Young’s modulus). This modulus indicates a material's stiffness or resistance to elastic deformation. Typical values range from 45 GPa (magnesium) to 407 GPa (tungsten). **Elastic deformation** is non-permanent, meaning the material returns to its original shape once the stress is removed.

- Stress-strain behaviour is linear in the elastic region, with the slope of the linear segment representing the modulus of elasticity.
    
- For nonlinear elastic behaviour, **tangent** or **secant moduli** are used to describe the relationship.
    
- At the atomic scale, elastic strain involves small changes in interatomic spacing, influenced by the interatomic bonding forces.
    

Materials like polymers and ceramics have lower or comparable moduli, influenced by their atomic bonding. Shear stress and strain are also proportional in the elastic region, with the **shear modulus** G describing this relationship.

## Anelasticity
Elastic deformation has generally been considered to be instantaneous and fully recoverable, but in reality, many materials exhibit _anelasticity_. This means elastic strain develops over time after stress application, and recovery is not immediate after the load is removed. In metals, anelastic effects are usually minor, but for some polymers, time-dependent elastic behaviour is significant and referred to as _viscoelasticity_


## Elastic properties of materials
When a tensile stress is applied to a metal specimen, it causes elongation along the direction of stress (z-axis) and contraction in the perpendicular directions (x and y). Poisson's ratio (𝜈) is defined as the negative ratio of lateral strain (in x or y) to axial strain (in z). For isotropic materials, where properties are uniform in all directions, 𝜀x = 𝜀y, and typical Poisson's ratio values for metals range between 0.25 and 0.35. The elastic and shear moduli (E and G) are mathematically related to Poisson's ratio. While most engineering materials assume isotropy, some materials exhibit elastic anisotropy, where their elastic behaviour varies with crystallographic direction. Polycrystalline and glass materials are generally considered isotropic due to their random grain orientation.

# Plastic Deformation
For metallic materials, elastic deformation occurs up to a strain of about 0.005, where stress remains proportional to strain (Hooke’s law applies). Beyond this, plastic deformation begins, which is permanent and nonrecoverable. This transition is gradual, with increasing stress causing larger deformations. At the atomic level, plastic deformation involves atoms breaking bonds with their original neighbors and forming new ones as they move. Crystalline materials deform through a process called slip (motion of dislocations), while non-crystalline solids and liquids deform via viscous flow.

## Tensile Properties
#### [[Plastic Deformation]] - metals' crystal lattice level
Plastic deformation - non reversible/ permanent, once the force is applied it wont return back to original position, its due to slip across the shear planes.
When the load ,F, is removed the stretched bonds snap back into place, recovering the elastic deformation, the permanent deformation that remains is the plastic deformation.

What are the important parameters to measure and calculate
1. Measure load, force -> Calculate STRESS, force per unit area.
2. Measure elongation -> Calculate STRAIN, elongation per unit length


[[Proportionality Limit]] - The point where the element is no longer elastic
[[Yield point]] - where the strain is more plastic then elastic
[[Yield Strength]] - The Stress of the Yield point
Tensile Strength - The maximum stress.

Important to know:
- Stiffness = E elastic or Young's Modulus
- Poisson's ratio = v
- Yield Strength = Reh , Rel, 0,2% proof strength
- Tensile Strength = UTS, Maximum TS
- Fracture Strength = Sigma f
- Elongation at fracture = epsilon f
- Ductility = % elongation
- Resilience = Elastic or recoverable strain energy per unit volume
- Toughness = total strain energy per unit volume
- Strain hardening = sigma T = K epsilon nt

#### Ductility
- **Definition**: Ductility measures the degree of plastic deformation a material sustains before fracturing. Brittle materials exhibit little to no plastic deformation.
    
- **Quantitative Expression**:
    
    - **Percent elongation (%EL)**: Calculated as %$EL = \left( \frac{l_f - l_0}{l_0} \right) \times 100$, where lf is the fracture length and l0 is the original gauge length.
        
    - **Percent reduction in area (%RA)**: Calculated as %$RA = \left( \frac{A_0 - A_f}{A_0} \right) \times 100$, where A_0 is the original cross-sectional area, and A_f is the cross-sectional area at fracture.
        
- **Significance**:
    
    1. It helps designers understand how much a material can deform plastically before breaking.
        
    2. Indicates the permissible deformation during fabrication processes. Ductile materials are more "forgiving" under stress.
        
- **Temperature Effects**: Most metals are ductile at room temperature, but some may become brittle when cooled. Ductility typically increases with temperature, while yield and tensile strength decrease.
    
- **Testing**: Tensile stress-strain tests are used to evaluate ductility, along with other mechanical properties like yield strength and tensile strength.


#### Resilience
**Resilience** is the ability of a material to absorb energy during elastic deformation and recover that energy upon unloading. The key property associated with resilience is the **modulus of resilience (Ur)**, which measures the strain energy per unit volume required to stress a material up to its yield point.

For materials with **linear elastic behavior**, the modulus of resilience is given by the formula:

$Ur = \frac{1}{2} \sigma_y \epsilon_y$

Where:

- $\sigma_y$: Yield stress
    
- $\epsilon_y$: Strain at yielding
    

Alternatively, using the relationship $ϵy=σy -->E\epsilon_y = \frac{\sigma_y}{E}$ (with E as the modulus of elasticity), the formula can be expressed as:

$Ur = \frac{\sigma_y^2}{2E}$

Materials with **high yield strengths** and **low moduli of elasticity** are considered resilient and often used in applications like springs. The units of resilience are joules per cubic meter (J/m³) or inch-pounds per cubic inch (in-lbf/in³), depending on the measurement system.

Additionally, mechanical properties of metals, such as yield strength, tensile strength, and ductility, influence resilience. For instance, materials like **steel, aluminum, titanium**, and **brass** exhibit different resilience characteristics based on their mechanical properties.


**Brittle < 5% elongation**
**Ductile > 5% elongation**

## Toughness
Toughness refers to a material's ability to resist fracture or absorb energy before breaking. Here's a concise breakdown:

- **Fracture Toughness**: Indicates resistance to cracking, vital for structural materials due to inevitable defects.
    
- **Energy Absorption**: Toughness also describes how much energy a material can absorb while plastically deforming before it fractures.
    
- **Testing Methods**:
    
    - **Dynamic Loading**: For high strain rates, toughness is assessed via impact tests (notch toughness).
        
    - **Static Loading**: Measured using tensile stress–strain tests, where the area under the curve represents toughness.
        
- **Properties Required**: Tough materials must combine **strength** and **ductility**. Brittle materials, despite high strength, often lack toughness.

## True Stress and Strain
- After reaching the maximum stress point (M), the metal appears weaker due to reduced load-bearing capacity caused by **rapid cross-sectional area reduction** in the neck region. However, the metal’s strength is actually increasing during deformation.
    
- **True Stress and Strain**:
    
    - **True Stress (σT)**: Calculated as load (F) divided by the instantaneous cross-sectional area (Ai).
        
    - **True Strain (εT)**: Derived as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the current length to the original length.
        
    - Relationships between true and engineering stress/strain are valid only up to necking.
        
- Beyond necking, true stress and strain are computed using actual measurements, accounting for complex stresses in the neck region.
    
- For some metals, the true stress–strain behavior in plastic deformation (pre-necking) follows: **σT = KεTⁿ**, where:
    
    - **K**: Strength coefficient.
        
    - **n**: Strain-hardening exponent (varies by material).

## Elastic Recovery after Plastic deformation
During a stress-strain test, when the load is released, part of the deformation is recovered as elastic strain. This recovery follows a straight-line path with a slope parallel to the initial elastic region of the curve, corresponding to the material's modulus of elasticity. This regained elastic strain is called strain recovery. If the load is reapplied, the material retraces the linear elastic portion and yields again at the stress level where unloading started. Similarly, there is elastic strain recovery even after fracture.

## Compressive, shear, and torsional deformations
 metals may experience plastic deformation under the influence of applied compressive, shear, and torsional loads. The resulting stress–strain behaviour into the plastic region is similar to the tensile counterpart (Figure 6.10a: yielding and the associated curvature). However, for compression, there is no maximum because necking does not occur; furthermore, the mode of fracture is different from that for tension.

## [[Hardness]]
Hardness measures a material's resistance to localized plastic deformation, such as dents or scratches. Early tests used the Mohs scale, based on the ability of materials to scratch each other, ranking from 1 (talc) to 10 (diamond). Modern methods use controlled indentation tests, where the size or depth of the dent indicates hardness—the softer the material, the deeper the indentation.

Hardness values are relative, not absolute, and different techniques can produce varying results. Hardness testing is popular because it's simple, affordable, and minimally destructive, and it can help estimate other mechanical properties, like tensile strength.

#### Rockwell hardness test
The Rockwell hardness test is a widely used and simple method to measure hardness without requiring special skills. It involves applying a minor load, followed by a major load, using various indenters such as steel balls or a diamond cone. The test determines hardness based on the depth of penetration.

There are two types of Rockwell tests: standard and superficial. Standard tests use a 10 kg minor load and major loads of 60, 100, or 150 kg, while superficial tests use a 3 kg minor load and major loads of 15, 30, or 45 kg. Each test is associated with specific scales denoted by letters (e.g., HRB for the B scale). Superficial tests are suitable for thin specimens.

Hardness measurements may range up to 130 on these scales, but values above 100 or below 20 are less accurate. Factors such as specimen thickness, proximity to edges, and smoothness affect accuracy. Modern automated apparatus simplifies testing and provides quick, direct readings while allowing variation in load application time.

#### Brinell Hardness test
The Brinell hardness test uses a hard spherical indenter (10 mm in diameter, made of steel or tungsten carbide) to measure the hardness of a metal surface. Loads ranging from 500 to 3000 kg are applied for 10–30 seconds, with harder materials requiring higher loads. The Brinell Hardness Number (BHN or HB) is determined based on the load and the diameter of the resulting indentation. A low-power microscope measures the indentation diameter, which is then converted to a hardness number using a chart.

Modern semiautomatic techniques include optical scanning systems that analyse indentations digitally for improved precision. This method requires a smooth, flat surface for consistent results. Brinell hardness is often compared to Rockwell hardness testing, which uses different scales, such as the "RC" for Rockwell C.

#### Knoop and Vickers hardness test
The Knoop and Vickers tests are micro-indentation techniques that use small diamond indenters with a pyramidal geometry to measure hardness. These methods are ideal for testing small specimen regions or brittle materials like ceramics. Applied loads are low (1–1000 g), and the resulting indentation is measured under a microscope, then converted to hardness numbers (HK for Knoop, HV for Vickers). Proper surface preparation is often required for accurate measurements. Modern equipment automates the process with image analysers and software, making it efficient and precise. These techniques are complementary to traditional methods like Rockwell and Brinell but are more specialized for delicate materials and precise regions.

#### Hardness Conversion
Hardness conversion between different scales is desirable but challenging due to the lack of a universal definition of hardness and differences in measurement techniques. Conversion data, determined experimentally, are material-specific and most reliable for steels. For these, conversions among Knoop, Vickers, Brinell, Rockwell, and Mohs scales exist, as shown in provided figures. Standardized conversion tables (e.g., ASTM E140) are available but require careful interpretation, especially when extrapolating data across different materials.

#### Correlation between Hardness and Tensile Strength
In summary, both tensile strength (TS) and hardness (HB) measure a metal's resistance to plastic deformation and are generally proportional for certain materials like cast iron, steel, and brass. However, this relationship doesn't apply universally to all metals. For most steels, a rule of thumb is:

- **TS (MPa)** = 3.45 × **HB**
    
- **TS (psi)** = 500 × **HB**
    

These equations illustrate the proportionality between tensile strength and hardness for steels.

## Variability of Material Properties
material properties are inherently variable, even with precise testing methods. Variability arises due to factors like testing methods, specimen fabrication, operator bias, apparatus calibration, and material inhomogeneity. This variability affects properties such as modulus of elasticity, yield strength, and tensile strength, as well as others like density and electrical conductivity.

Design engineers must accept and manage this variability, often using statistical methods like averages and standard deviations to quantify scatter in measurements. Instead of asking for a single property value, engineers should consider probabilities, such as the likelihood of failure under specific conditions.

Key properties and their measures include:

- Modulus of elasticity (stiffness)
    
- Yield strength (resistance to plastic deformation)
    
- Tensile strength (maximum load capacity)
    
- Ductility (extent of plastic deformation)
    
- Modulus of resilience (elastic energy absorption)
    
- Toughness (plastic energy absorption)
    
- Hardness (localized surface resistance).
    

#### Computation of average and standard deviation values
Statistical calculations are defined as follows:

- Average: $x = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$
- 
    
- Standard deviation: $s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - x)^2}{n - 1}}$.
    

Ultimately, engineers should approach material properties with an understanding of their inherent variability and incorporate this into design practices.

## Safety
determining applied loads and stresses in engineering materials. It highlights that imperfections, variability in properties, and potential damage must be considered. Traditional approaches used safety factors to reduce applied stress, but this method is inadequate for critical applications (e.g., aircraft, bridges). Modern approaches focus on using tough materials, redundancy in design, and regular inspections for critical components.

For less critical applications, _design stress_ (𝜎d) is calculated based on anticipated maximum loads, using a design factor (Nʹ), whereas _safe stress_ (𝜎w) is determined using the material’s yield strength divided by a safety factor (N). Choosing an appropriate N value balances safety, cost, and material usage. Tougher materials and redundant designs are increasingly preferred to reduce weight and costs while enhancing safety.
