# Introduction to Material Science

### Structure
In  brief, the structure of a material usually relates to the arrangement of its internal components.
Structural elements may be classified on the basis of size and in this regard there are several levels:
• [[Subatomic]] structure — involves electrons within the individual atoms, their energies and interactions with the nuclei.
• [[Atomic structure]] — relates to the organization of atoms to yield molecules or crystals.
• [[Nanostructure]] — deals with aggregates of atoms that form particles (nanoparticles) that have nanoscale dimensions (less that about 100 nm).
• [[Microstructure]] — those structural elements that are subject to direct observation using some type of microscope (structural features having dimensions between 100 nm and several millimetres).
• [[Macrostructure]] — structural elements that may be viewed with the naked eye (with scale range between several millimetres and on the order of a meter).


### Properties
Almost all important properties of solid materials can be grouped into six different categories
•[[Mechanical]] properties—relate deformation to an applied load or force; examples include elastic modulus (stiffness), strength, and resistance to fracture. 
• [[Electrical]] properties—the stimulus is an applied electric field; typical properties include electrical conductivity and dielectric constant.
• [[Thermal]] properties—are related to changes in temperature or temperature gradients across a material; examples of thermal behaviour include thermal expansion and heat capacity.
• [[Magnetic]] properties—the responses of a material to the application of a magnetic field; common magnetic properties include magnetic susceptibility and magnetization.
• [[Optical]] properties—the stimulus is electromagnetic or light radiation; index of re- fraction and reflectivity are representative optical properties. 
• [[Deteriorative]] characteristics—relate to the chemical reactivity of materials; for example, corrosion resistance of metals.



### [[Engineering Materials Primary Groups]]
3 Primary Groups 
	1. [[Metals]] 
		Metals have a solid crystal lattice structure (very ordered structure)
		Dense Compared to other materials
		Characteristics:
			Stiff
			Strong
			Ductile
			resistant to fracture
			Good conductors of electricity and heat
	2. [[Ceramics]]
		Ceramics have an ionic bond ( metal and non metal )
		Mix between Metal and Polymer
		Characteristics:
			Stiff and Strong - comparable to metals 
			Very hard therefore extreme brittleness (lack of ductility)
			insulative to heat and electricity transfer
	3. [[Polymers]]
		Polymers have Chain bonds ( super long carbon chains )
		Organic Compounds, do not have any metal
		Characteristics:
			Low Density
			Dissimilar to those of metallic and ceramic materials
			Extremely Ductile and pliable
			relatively inert
			Low conductivity of electricity
			tendency to soften under modest temperatures

A mixture of the main groups is a [[composite]]
	Designed to have a combination of properties of the 2 materials


### [[Atomic and Interatomic Bonding]]
- Each Atom has a nucleus.
- Each Chemical Element is characterized by atomic number , Z, Equal to number of protons in the nucleus.
- Atomic Mass , A , of an element is equal to sum of neutrons and protons in nucleus.
- Having different neutrons means you have a different isotope of the element.
- A is the weighted average of all isotopes of the element

#### [[Bohr's Atomic Model]]
- Limited model, assumes electrons have both wave and particle characteristics and energy of electron can be quantized.
- The size shape and spatial orientation of an electrons probability density are characterized by Quantum numbers.
- Valence electrons are the electrons that occupy the outermost shell of an atom. - determines how atoms bond with each-other.

#### [[The Periodic Table]]

### [[Atomic Bonding]]
The net force acting on two atoms brought very close together is Fa + Fr = Fn

when this force is zero the forces are in equilibrium and the [[interatomic]] spacing is r0, the equilibrium spacing (~0.3nm).
the Net potential energy between two atoms can also be determines Ea + Er = En and is a minimum at r0 with a value of E0.
E0 is the bonding energy of the two atoms.
	bond energy is the energy required to move the atoms infinitely far apart, aka break the bond.


### [[Types of bonds]]

1. [[Metallic Bonding]]
	Valence electrons are not bound to any particular atom in the solid to any particular atom, are more or less free to drift throughout entire metal.
2. [[Ionic Bonding]]
	Between a metal and a non-metal, one steals the electron and they are bonded together.
3. [[Covalent Bonding]]
	Two elements close to each other on periodic table ( small electronegativity difference) share valence electrons.
	Is a strong bond.
4. Secondary [[van der waals]] bonding
5. mixed bonding
	1. Covalent - ionic : most ceramics.
	2. Covalent - Metallic.
	3. Metallic - Ionic.

#### Important Distinction
Particles can be atoms, molecules or ions.
Atoms are single neutral particles 
Molecules are neutral particles made of two or more atoms bonded together
Compounds are special types of molecules where two or more **_DIFFERENT_** atoms are bonded together.
An ion is a positively or negatively charged particle.
