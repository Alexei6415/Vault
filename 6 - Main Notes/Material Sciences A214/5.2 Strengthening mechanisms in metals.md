# 5.2 Strengthening mechanisms in metals
metallurgical and materials engineers design alloys with high strength, ductility, and toughness, though increasing strength often reduces ductility. Alloy selection is influenced by a material's adaptability to specific mechanical needs. Strengthening mechanisms involve restricting dislocation motion, as reduced dislocation mobility increases mechanical strength, while free dislocation movement makes metals softer and weaker. Common techniques for strengthening single-phase metals include grain size reduction, solid-solution alloying, and strain hardening. Strengthening multiphase alloys involves more complex approaches beyond this discussion.

##### Strengthening methods
1. [[Grain size reduction]]
	1. increases grains per unit volume
	2. hinders dislocation motion
2. [[Solid solution strengthening]]
	1. increases lattice distortion
	2. hinders dislocation motion
3. [[Strain hardening]]
	1. increase dislocation density
	2. hinder dislocation motion

## Grain size reduction
The grain size in polycrystalline metals significantly impacts mechanical properties like strength and toughness. Grains, separated by grain boundaries, differ in crystallographic orientation. During plastic deformation, dislocations (defects within crystals) must cross these grain boundaries, which act as barriers. There are two main reasons:

1. The change in crystallographic orientation at the boundary makes dislocation movement harder.
    
2. The atomic disorder within the boundary causes a discontinuity in the slip planes (the planes along which dislocations move).
    

In cases of high-angle grain boundaries, dislocations may "pile up," creating stress concentrations that can produce new dislocations in neighbouring grains. Fine-grained materials (with smaller grains) are stronger because they have more grain boundaries to block dislocation motion. This relationship is described by the Hall–Petch equation:

${Yield Strength, } \sigma_y = \sigma_0 + k_y d^{-1/2}$

Here, d is the grain diameter, and σ, k_y are material-specific constants.

Grain size can be controlled through methods like rapid solidification and heat treatment, influencing not just strength but also toughness. However, the Hall–Petch relationship doesn't apply to materials with extremely large or small grains.

### Further Explanation

- **Grain Boundaries and Strength**: Grain boundaries hinder dislocation motion, making finer grains preferable for stronger materials. Think of grain boundaries as speed bumps for dislocations—they slow movement and increase resistance to deformation.
    
- **Dislocation Pile-Up**: In high-angle boundaries, dislocations can't easily cross, so they accumulate ("pile-up"). This leads to stress build-up, triggering new dislocations in nearby grains, which enhances material strength.
    
- **Hall–Petch Equation**: The equation mathematically explains how smaller grains increase yield strength. Smaller grains mean more boundaries, increasing resistance to deformation.


## Solid solution strengthening
##### Substitutional impurity atoms
smaller than host - larger than host (Bigger or smaller than the [[Interstitial]] size )
	tensile/compressive lattice strain
	Hinders dislocation motion

Increase in wt% of impurity atoms 
(alloying) increases lattice strains

Hinders dislocation motion
	Increases yield and tensile strength
	Decrease % elongation

Solid-solution strengthening is a method to enhance metal strength and hardness by introducing impurity atoms into the metal's crystal structure. These impurity atoms can occupy either substitutional or interstitial positions, creating lattice strains around them. As a result, dislocation movement is restricted, increasing the material's tensile and yield strengths. 

Smaller impurity atoms exert tensile strains, while larger ones impose compressive strains on the lattice. These atoms tend to gather near dislocations, reducing strain energy. However, this arrangement makes slip resistance higher, requiring greater stress for plastic deformation in alloys compared to pure metals. Thus, alloys are generally stronger and harder than their pure metal counterparts.




## Strain hardening
	aka cold hardening
What is cold work?
Plastic deformation of a metal at a temperature relatively low compared to its meting point.
- Increases dislocation density
- Increased resistance to dislocation motion (lattice strain fields repel each other mostly)

Hinders dislocation motion
	Increases yield and tensile strength
	Decrease % elongation


### Using cold hardening and heat treatment to manipulate properties
- Strain hardening increases strength (resistance to deformation) and decreases ductility by increasing dislocation density
- How can we reduce the dislocation density in order to allow further deformation ( forming) or to increase ductility and toughness?
how ?
Heat treatment (annealing) -> recovery -> recrystallisation -> Grain Growth

**Strain hardening** (also known as work hardening or cold working) is when ductile metals become harder and stronger through plastic deformation, often at room temperature. The degree of deformation can be measured as **percent cold work (%CW)**, calculated using the original and deformed cross-sectional areas. Increasing %CW boosts **yield and tensile strength** but reduces **ductility** (percent elongation).

This phenomenon happens because deformation increases the metal's **dislocation density**, causing repulsive interactions between dislocations that hinder their movement. As a result, more stress is needed to further deform the metal. Strain hardening is widely used in metal fabrication to enhance mechanical properties, though its effects can be reversed via **annealing heat treatments**.

Additionally, strain hardening works alongside other strengthening mechanisms like **grain size reduction** and **solid-solution strengthening**. However, some strengthening effects, unlike solid-solution strengthening, can be diminished with heat treatments.


## Recovery, Recrystallization, and Grain Growth
Plastic deformation of polycrystalline metals at low temperatures causes changes including grain shape alteration, strain hardening, increased dislocation density, and stored strain energy. This deformation may also affect properties like electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance. However, through heat treatment (annealing), the material's structure and properties can return to their original state via recovery, recrystallization, and potential grain growth.

### Recovery
- Below Tr but above RT
- Stored internal strain energy relieved by dislocation motion
- Reduction in dislocation density; no change to grain shape or size
- marginal effect of strength & ductility; electrical & thermal conductivity restored

During recovery, stored internal strain energy is reduced due to dislocation motion, enabled by atomic diffusion at elevated temperatures. This process decreases the number of dislocations and forms configurations with lower strain energy. Additionally, physical properties like electrical and thermal conductivities return to their original, pre-cold-worked states.

### Recrystallization
- Above Tr: 0.4Tm pure metals - 0.7 Tm alloys
- Formation of a new set of strain-free, equiaxed grains that have a low dislocation density
- Driving force: *reduction in stored strain energy*
	- Critical level of CW required for recrystallization
- Strength & ductility restored to precold-worked state

Recrystallization involves the formation of new, strain-free, equiaxed grains with low dislocation densities, restoring the mechanical properties of cold-worked metals to their original state. The process is driven by the energy difference between strained and unstrained materials and depends on time, temperature, and factors like prior cold work and purity. Recrystallization lowers the hardness and strength while increasing ductility. It occurs more rapidly in pure metals than alloys and is influenced by impurities, which can raise the recrystallization temperature. Typically, recrystallization temperatures range from 0.4 to 0.7 times the absolute melting temperature. Heat treatments are designed to optimize the process, and the extent of recrystallization is time- and temperature-dependent.

### Grain Growth
- Occurs by the migration of grain boundaries
- Large grains grow and consume smaller grains (atomic diffusion)
- Reduction in grain boundary area -> reduces energy of system
- Hall-Petch : increase d -> decrease strength
- Time dependent (diffusion - mass flow)

Grain growth occurs when strain-free grains enlarge due to elevated temperatures, even without prior recovery or recrystallization. This phenomenon happens in polycrystalline materials, reducing total boundary energy as larger grains grow at the expense of smaller ones. Grain boundaries migrate through short-range atomic diffusion, with motion directions opposing atomic flow.

Grain growth is time and temperature-dependent, following the equation $$d^n - d_0^n = Kt$$, where grain diameter increases with time. Higher temperatures accelerate growth due to faster diffusion rates. Fine-grained metals typically exhibit better mechanical properties (strength and toughness) than coarse-grained ones. If grain refinement is needed, plastic deformation followed by recrystallization heat treatment can be applied.

## Summary
### Microscopic Plastic Deformation

- **Plastic deformation** corresponds to the motion of dislocations in response to externally applied shear stress.
    
    - For **edge dislocations**, dislocation line motion and the direction of applied shear stress are parallel.
        
    - For **screw dislocations**, these directions are perpendicular.
        
    - **Edge dislocation strains:** Tensile, compressive, and shear strains exist near the dislocation line.
        
    - **Screw dislocation strains:** Only shear lattice strains occur.
        

### Basic Concepts

- **Slip:** The motion of dislocations in response to externally applied shear stress.
    
- Occurs on specific crystallographic planes and in certain directions only.
    
- A **slip system** consists of a slip plane and a slip direction:
    
    - **Slip plane:** Densest atomic packing plane.
        
    - **Slip direction:** Closest atomic packing direction.
        
- Slip systems depend on the material’s crystal structure.
    

### Slip Systems

- **Resolved shear stress:** Shear stress resulting from applied tensile stress that is resolved on a plane neither parallel nor perpendicular to the stress direction.
    
- **Critical resolved shear stress:** Minimum resolved shear stress required to initiate dislocation motion (slip).
    

### Slip in Single Crystals

- For a single crystal under tension, **small surface steps** form, parallel to and looping around the specimen.
    

### Plastic Deformation of Polycrystalline Materials

- Slip occurs in each grain along the most favorably oriented slip systems with applied stress.
    
- Grains change shape and elongate in directions of gross plastic deformation.
    

### Deformation by Twinning

- Under certain conditions, **BCC** and **HCP metals** may experience limited plastic deformation via twinning.
    
- **Mechanical twins** form due to applied shear forces.
    

### Mechanisms of Strengthening in Metals

1. **Grain Size Reduction**
    
    - Grain boundaries act as barriers to dislocation motion because:
        
        1. A dislocation’s motion direction must change when crossing a boundary.
            
        2. Slip planes are discontinuous at boundaries.
            
    - **Smaller grains = stronger metal** (more grain boundary area).
        
2. **Solid-Solution Strengthening**
    
    - Increased impurity atom concentration enhances strength and hardness by reducing dislocation mobility.
        
    - Lattice strain interactions between impurity atoms and dislocations lower mobility.
        
3. **Strain Hardening**
    
    - Strength and hardness increase while ductility decreases with plastic deformation.
        
    - Yield strength, tensile strength, and hardness rise with more cold work, while ductility decreases.
        
    - During plastic deformation:
        
        - Dislocation density increases.
            
        - Interactions between dislocations reduce mobility, increasing strength.
            

### Recovery

- Internal strain energy is partially relieved as dislocations move.
    
- **Dislocation density decreases**, and dislocations adopt low-energy configurations.
    
- Some material properties revert to pre-cold-worked values.
    

### Recrystallization

- Formation of new, strain-free equiaxed grains with low dislocation densities.
    
    - Metal becomes softer, weaker, and more ductile.
        
- **Recrystallization temperature:** Temperature at which recrystallization completes in 1 hour.
    
    - Increases with impurity content.
        
    - Decreases with higher cold work percentages.
        
- **Hot working:** Deformation above recrystallization temperature.
    
- **Cold working:** Deformation below recrystallization temperature.
    

### Grain Growth

- Grain size increases due to grain boundary motion.
    
- Time dependence of grain growth follows **Equation 7.9**.
