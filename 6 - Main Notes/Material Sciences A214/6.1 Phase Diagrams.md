## Basic Terminology
**Components** : found on the x axis can be single elements or compounds (e.g. Cu or SiO2/Al2O3).
**System** : group of alloys with the same components but different compositions.

Solute: What you are adding to the system (Normally in smaller proportion)
Solvent : What is originally present in the System.
Solution : the combination of solute and solvent.

Solubility Limit : The Solubility limit is when no more solute can be "dissolved" or added to the solution/solvent.

Unsaturated : When there is only 1 phase present for a certain composition of solute.
Saturated : when the solution is fully saturated and if any more Solute is added if will remain as a solid.

solid solution: consists of atoms of at least 2 different types: the solute atoms occupy either substitutional or interstitial positions in the solvent lattice and the crystal structure of the solvent is maintained.


### Solubility Limit
The passage discusses the concept of a **solubility limit**, which is the maximum amount of solute (like salt or sugar) that can dissolve in a solvent (like water) at a specific temperature to form a solid solution (or liquid solution, in the case of sugar water).

Here's a breakdown to help you understand and memorize:

- **Solubility Limit:** Imagine a point beyond which no more of something can be dissolved in something else at a particular temperature. Think of it as the "saturation point."
    
- **Analogy (Sugar-Water):**
    
    - Initially, adding sugar to water creates a sugar-water solution (syrup).
        
    - As you add more sugar, the solution becomes more concentrated.
        
    - Once you reach the solubility limit, the water is "saturated" with sugar.
        
    - Any further sugar you add will not dissolve and will remain as solid crystals.
        
- **Two Outcomes Beyond the Limit:** When you exceed the solubility limit, you'll either get another solid solution with a different composition or a completely new compound forming alongside the original solution. In the sugar-water example, it's the same sugar as solid crystals.
    
- **Temperature Matters:** The solubility limit isn't fixed. It changes with temperature. The passage mentions that for sugar in water, the solubility slightly increases as the water gets hotter.
    
- **Graphical Representation:** This solubility limit can be shown on a graph with temperature on the vertical axis (ordinate) and the composition (percentage of solute, like sugar) on the horizontal axis (abscissa).
    
    - The line on the graph represents the solubility limit.
        
    - To the left of the line: Only the solution (syrup) exists.
        
    - To the right of the line: Both the solution (syrup) and the undissolved solute (solid sugar) coexist.
        
- **Composition:** The passage points out that if you have a two-component system (like sugar and water), the total concentration will always add up to 100%. So, if you know the percentage of sugar, you automatically know the percentage of water.
    

**Tips for Memorization:**

- **Visualize the sugar-water example:** It's a relatable scenario we've all likely encountered.
    
- **Focus on the "limit" aspect:** The key is that there's a maximum that can be dissolved.
    
- **Connect temperature to solubility:** Generally, heat helps dissolve solids in liquids (though there are exceptions).
    
- **Imagine the graph:** Picture the line separating the "fully dissolved" region from the "partially dissolved" region.


### Phases
A phase is a part of a system which is homogenous and has distinct properties from other parts of the system.
- **Definition of a Phase:** A phase is a **homogeneous** part of a system that has **uniform physical and chemical characteristics** throughout. Think of it as a region where everything looks and acts the same chemically and physically.  
    
- **Examples of Phases:**
    - **Pure materials:** A block of pure iron is one phase.
    - **Solutions:**
        - Sugar-water syrup is one liquid phase.
        - Air is one gaseous phase (a solution of different gases).  
            
        - A solid solution like brass (copper and zinc) is one solid phase.  
            
- **Key Differences Between Phases:** If a system has more than one phase, each phase will have its own unique set of properties. These differences can be:
    
    - **Physical:** Solid vs. liquid vs. gas, different crystal structures (like ice and water).
    - **Chemical:** Different compositions (like pure sugar vs. sugar-water solution).
    - **Both:** Often, there will be differences in both.
    
     
    
- **Phase Boundaries:** Between different phases, there's a distinct **boundary** where the physical and/or chemical characteristics change **abruptly** and **discontinuously**. Imagine the sharp interface between ice and water.  
    
- **Polymorphism:** If a material can exist in more than one crystal structure (like FCC and BCC for some metals), each structure is considered a **separate phase** because they have different physical properties.
- **Homogeneous vs. Heterogeneous Systems:**
    - **Homogeneous:** A system with only **one phase**. It's uniform throughout.
    - **Heterogeneous:** A system with **two or more phases**. It's a mixture. Most alloys, ceramics, polymers, and composites are heterogeneous.  
        
- **Benefit of Heterogeneous Systems:** Often, combining different phases in a material results in a property combination that is better than what any single phase could offer on its own. Think of the strength of steel which comes from the interaction of different iron and carbon-containing phases.

**Tips for Memorization:**

- **Think "Uniformity":** The key to a phase is its uniformity in both what it's made of (chemical) and how it exists (physical).  
    
- **Water as a Good Example:** Water in its different forms (ice, liquid, steam) illustrates phases with the same chemical composition but different physical properties.  
    
- **Solutions are Single Phases:** Remember that even solutions (like salt water or air) count as a single phase because they are uniform at a macroscopic level.  
    
- **Heterogeneous = Multiple "Looks" or "Compositions":** A heterogeneous system will have visually or chemically distinct regions.  
    
- **"Boundary" is Like a Border:** Imagine a line separating two distinct territories with different rules or characteristics.


### Microstructure
Allows us to see if a change in temperature had the wanted effect.

The passage explains that the **microstructure** of a material is very important because it influences its physical, especially its mechanical, properties. Microstructure is what you see when you look at a material under a microscope (either optical or electron). In metal alloys, microstructure is defined by:

- The number of different **phases** present.
    
- The **proportions** of these phases.
    
- How these phases are **distributed** or arranged within the material.
    

The microstructure of an alloy is not fixed and depends on several factors:

- The types of **alloying elements** that are added.
    
- The **concentrations** of these elements.
    
- The **heat treatment** applied to the alloy. Heat treatment involves specific temperature cycles (heating, holding, and cooling) that can significantly alter the microstructure.
    

To study the microstructure, a sample needs to be carefully prepared by **polishing** and then **etching**. Etching involves treating the surface with chemicals to make the different phases visible under the microscope. Different phases will often appear with different shades or textures (e.g., one phase might look light, and another dark). If the material is a single phase, the view will be uniform except for the **grain boundaries**, which are the interfaces between individual crystals within the solid.


### Phase Equilibrium
free energy at minimum
Phase characteristics constant over time.
Applies to solid solution phases too
Non-equilibrium : metastable state( very small changes over time)


## Phase Diagrams
diagram that described the occurrence of different phases of a system in equilibrium.
Externally controlled parameters
	Temperature
	Composition
	Pressure

#### Unary Phase Diagram
When of the the parameters is constant and the other 2 are on the axis(normally composition is constant).

Triple point/invariant  - when 3 phases meet at 1 point.

#### Binary Phase Diagrams
- Pressure held constant at 1 atm
- Temperature and composition are varied
- Binary alloys = two components
Ternary systems do exist but hard to represent

Binary isomorphous system
	A binary isomorphous system refers to a type of phase diagram that illustrates the relationship between two components that are completely soluble in each other in both liquid and solid states. The term "isomorphous" means "having the same form," so in this context, the two components form a single continuous series of solid solutions.

Binary = two components
Isomorphous = complete liquid and solid solubility of two components. 

Liquidus line : separates the Liquid field from the solid and liquid field.
Solidus line : separates the Solid field from the solid and liquid field
