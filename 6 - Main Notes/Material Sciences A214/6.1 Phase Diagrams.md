## Basic Terminology
**Components** : found on the x axis can be single elements or compounds (e.g. Cu or SiO2/Al2O3).
**System** : group of alloys with the same components but different compositions.

Solute: What you are adding to the system (Normally in smaller proportion)
Solvent : What is originally present in the System.
Solution : the combination of solute and solvent.

Solubility Limit : The Solubility limit is when no more solute can be "dissolved" or added to the solution/solvent.

Unsaturated : When there is only 1 phase present for a certain composition of solute.
Saturated : when the solution is fully saturated and if any more Solute is added if will remain as a solid.


### Phases
A phase is a part of a system which is homogenous and has distinct properties from other parts of the system.


### Microstructure
Allows us to see if a change in temperature had the wanted effect.


### Phase Equilibrium
free energy at minimum
Phase characteristics constant over time.
Applies to solid solution phases too
Non-equilibrium : metastable state( very small changes over time)


## Phase Diagrams
diagram that described the occurrence of different phases of a system in equilibrium.
Externally controlled parameters
	Temperature
	Composition
	Pressure

#### Unary Phase Diagram
When of the the parameters is constant and the other 2 are on the axis(normally composition is constant).

Triple point/invariant  - when 3 phases meet at 1 point.

#### Binary Phase Diagrams
- Pressure held constant at 1 atm
- Temperature and composition are varied
- Binary alloys = two components
Ternary systems do exist but hard to represent

Binary isomorphous system
	A binary isomorphous system refers to a type of phase diagram that illustrates the relationship between two components that are completely soluble in each other in both liquid and solid states. The term "isomorphous" means "having the same form," so in this context, the two components form a single continuous series of solid solutions.

Binary = two components
Isomorphous = complete liquid and solid solubility of two components. 

Liquidus line : separates the Liquid field from the solid and liquid field.
Solidus line : separates the Solid field from the solid and liquid field
