# 11.3 fabrication and processing of Ceramics

#### Why worry about ceramic processing

* **High Melting Point:** Ceramics generally have very high melting points, making casting difficult compared to metals.
* **Very Brittle:** Ceramics are typically brittle and lack ductility, making forming through plastic deformation challenging.

The processing methods for ceramics vary depending on the specific type of ceramic.

 ## Glasses

#### Properties

Non-crystalline materials like glasses differ from crystalline materials in their solidification process. Instead of a sharp melting point, glasses transition continuously from a liquid to a more viscous supercooled liquid as temperature decreases. This transition is characterized by the **glass transition temperature (Tg)** or fictive temperature, where the slope of the specific volume vs. temperature curve changes slightly. Below Tg, the material is considered a glass.

Upon heating, glasses exhibit specific viscosity points important for processing:

* **Strain Point (3 × 10¹³ Pa·s):** Below this temperature, glass will fracture before any plastic deformation occurs.
* **Annealing Point (10¹² Pa·s):** At this temperature, atomic diffusion is rapid enough to relieve residual stresses within approximately 15 minutes.
* **Softening Point (4 × 10⁶ Pa·s):** This is the maximum temperature at which a glass piece can be handled without significant dimensional changes.
* **Working Point (10³ Pa·s):** The glass is easily deformed at this viscosity.
* **Melting Point (10 Pa·s):** The viscosity is low enough for the glass to be considered a fluid liquid.
* **Working Range:** The temperature range between the softening and working points is where most glass-forming operations are carried out. The specific temperatures for these points depend on the glass composition.

##### Raw Materials

Most commercial glasses are **silica-soda-lime glasses**, composed of:

* **Silica (SiO₂):** Usually supplied as quartz sand.
* **Soda (Na₂O):** Added as soda ash (Na₂CO₃).
* **Lime (CaO):** Added as limestone (CaCO₃).

For high-quality glass, especially for optical applications, it's crucial to achieve **homogeneity** through complete melting and mixing of the raw materials. **Porosity** due to gas bubbles must also be eliminated by adjusting the viscosity of the molten material.

##### Pressing

Pressing is used for fabricating relatively thick-walled glass pieces like plates and dishes. The process involves applying pressure to a gob of molten glass within a graphite-coated cast iron mold of the desired shape. The mold is typically heated to ensure a smooth surface finish.

##### Drawing

Drawing is employed to produce long glass pieces with a constant cross-section, such as sheets, rods, tubing, and fibers.

* **Float Process (Sheet Glass):** This economical process involves passing molten glass from a melting furnace onto a bath of molten tin within a controlled atmosphere furnace. The glass ribbon "floats" on the tin, allowing gravity and surface tension to create perfectly flat and parallel surfaces of uniform thickness. The sheet is then cooled, fire-polished, passed through an annealing furnace (lehr) to relieve stresses, and finally cut into sections.

* **Fiber Forming:** Continuous glass fibers are made by drawing molten glass through many small orifices at the base of a heated platinum chamber. The glass viscosity, controlled by temperature, is a critical factor in this process.

#### Heat Treatment of Glass

##### Annealing:

Annealing is performed to relieve **thermal stresses** that can be introduced during cooling due to differences in cooling rates between the surface and the interior of the glass. Faster cooling of the surface compared to the interior can lead to these stresses, which can weaken brittle ceramics like glass and potentially cause fracture (**thermal shock**). Annealing involves heating the glassware to the annealing point and then slowly cooling it to room temperature to eliminate or reduce these stresses.

##### Glass Tempering

Glass tempering, also known as **thermal tempering**, is a heat treatment used to significantly increase the strength of a glass piece. This is achieved by intentionally inducing **compressive residual stresses** on the surface of the glass.

**Thermal Tempering Process:**

1.  The glassware is heated to a temperature above the glass transition region but below the softening point.
2.  It is then rapidly cooled to room temperature using jets of air (or sometimes an oil bath).

**Mechanism:** The surface cools and becomes rigid more quickly than the interior. As the interior continues to cool and attempts to contract, the rigid surface restricts this contraction, resulting in compressive stresses on the surface and tensile stresses in the interior. Because cracks in brittle materials typically initiate at the surface due to tensile stresses, the compressive surface stress in tempered glass must first be overcome by an external tensile force before a crack can form and propagate. This makes tempered glass much stronger than untempered glass. It is used in applications requiring high strength, such as large doors and eyeglass lenses.


## Clay Products:

#### Properties

Clay products are primarily made from **clay minerals**, which are **aluminosilicates** composed of **alumina (Al₂O₃)**, **silica (SiO₂)**, and **chemically bound water (H₂O)**. Key characteristics of clay include:

* **Layered Crystal Structure:** Clay minerals, particularly kaolinite, have a layered structure.
* **Hydroplasticity:** When mixed with water, clay becomes very plastic and pliable (hydroplastic), allowing it to be easily molded without cracking due to water molecules fitting between the layers.
* **Fusion During Firing:** Clay fuses or melts over a range of temperatures, enabling the production of a dense and strong ceramic piece during firing while maintaining its shape. The fusion temperature range depends on the clay's composition.
* **Impurities:** Common impurities in clays include compounds (oxides) of barium, calcium, sodium, potassium, iron, and some organic matter.

Many clay products, especially **whitewares** (like porcelain), also contain nonplastic ingredients:

* **Flint (Finely Ground Quartz):** Used as a filler material due to its low cost, relative hardness, and chemical inertness. It remains largely unchanged during firing but can form a glass if melted at higher temperatures.
* **Flux (e.g., Feldspar):** A substance that promotes the formation of a glassy phase at lower temperatures during firing. Feldspars are aluminosilicate materials containing ions like K⁺, Na⁺, and Ca²⁺.

The proportions of clay, quartz, and flux influence the drying and firing processes and the final characteristics of the ceramic product. A typical porcelain might contain roughly 50% clay, 25% quartz, and 25% feldspar.

#### Fabrication Techniques

Raw materials usually undergo **milling or grinding** to reduce particle size, followed by **screening or sizing** to obtain a powder with the desired particle size range. For mixtures, powders are thoroughly mixed with water and sometimes other additives to achieve appropriate flow characteristics for the chosen forming technique. The formed ("green") piece must have enough mechanical strength to withstand handling, drying, and firing. Two common shaping methods are:

###### Hydroplastic Forming:

* Clay mixed with water becomes plastic and pliable, allowing molding.
* The consistency (water-clay ratio) must provide sufficient yield strength for the formed ware to hold its shape during handling and drying, despite having a low overall yield strength.
* The most common hydroplastic forming technique is **extrusion**, where a stiff plastic ceramic mass is forced through a die orifice to create a specific cross-sectional geometry. Bricks, pipes, ceramic blocks, and tiles are commonly made this way.
* The plastic ceramic is often forced through the die using a motor-driven auger, and a vacuum chamber is sometimes used to remove air and increase density. Inserts within the die can create hollow internal columns in the extruded piece (e.g., in bricks).

###### Slip Casting:

* A **slip** is a suspension of clay and/or other nonplastic materials in water.
* The slip is poured into a **porous mold**, typically made of **plaster of Paris**.
* Water from the slip is absorbed into the mold, leaving a solid layer of the ceramic material on the mold wall. The thickness of this layer depends on the casting time.
* **Solid Casting:** The process continues until the entire mold cavity is filled with solid material.
* **Drain Casting:** The process is stopped when the solid shell wall reaches the desired thickness. The mold is inverted, and the excess slip is poured out.
* As the cast piece dries and shrinks, it detaches from the mold wall, allowing the mold to be disassembled and the piece removed.
* The properties of the slip (high specific gravity, fluidity, pourability, appropriate solid-to-water ratio, added agents) and the mold (porosity) are critical for a satisfactory casting rate, bubble-free castings, low drying shrinkage, and high strength in the green body.
* Slip casting is used to create complex shapes like sanitary ware, art objects, and specialized laboratory equipment (e.g., ceramic tubes).

###### Drying

* After forming (by hydroplastic forming or slip casting), the ceramic piece is called a **green ceramic body**. It contains significant porosity and insufficient strength for most applications. It also contains water added during forming, which needs to be removed.
* **Drying** removes this liquid, leading to **shrinkage**.
* In the early stages of drying, water films surround clay particles. As drying progresses, these films disappear, and the particles move closer, causing shrinkage.
* Controlling the rate of water removal is crucial to prevent **warpage, distortion, and cracks** due to nonuniform shrinkage. The rate of surface evaporation should be no greater than the rate of water diffusion from the interior.
* Factors influencing shrinkage and drying defects:
    * **Drying Rate:** Evaporation rate (controlled by temperature, humidity, airflow) vs. diffusion rate within the body.
    * **Body Thickness:** Thicker pieces are more prone to nonuniform shrinkage and cracking.
    * **Water Content:** Higher initial water content leads to more extensive shrinkage. Water content in the slip is kept as low as possible.
    * **Clay Particle Size:** Smaller particle sizes result in increased shrinkage. Increasing particle size or adding larger nonplastic particles can minimize shrinkage.
    * **Microwave Drying:** Can be used at lower temperatures (below 50°C) for temperature-sensitive materials.

###### Firing

* After drying, the **green body** is heated in a process called **firing** at temperatures typically between 900°C and 1400°C (1650°F and 2550°F), depending on the composition and desired properties.
* Firing further increases the **density** (reduces porosity) and enhances the **mechanical strength** of the ceramic.

###### Vitrification:

* During firing of clay-based materials at high temperatures, **vitrification** occurs. This is the gradual formation of a liquid glass phase that flows into and fills the pore volume due to capillary action.
* The degree of vitrification depends on the **firing temperature and time**, as well as the **composition** of the body.
* **Fluxing agents** like feldspar lower the temperature at which the liquid phase forms, promoting vitrification.
* Upon cooling, this fused phase solidifies into a **glassy matrix** that binds the remaining unmelted particles (e.g., quartz) together, resulting in a dense and strong body. The final microstructure includes the vitrified phase, unreacted quartz particles, and some residual porosity.
* The degree of vitrification directly influences the room-temperature properties of the ceramic ware: higher vitrification leads to increased strength, durability, and density.
* Firing temperatures vary depending on the desired product:
    * Building bricks are typically fired around 900°C and are relatively porous.
    * Highly vitrified porcelain, which can be translucent, is fired at much higher temperatures (e.g., around 1200°C) to achieve very high density. Complete vitrification needs to be controlled to prevent the body from becoming too soft and collapsing during firing.


###### Powder Pressing

Powder pressing, akin to powder metallurgy for metals, is a common technique used to fabricate ceramic components from both clay and nonclay compositions. This includes electronic, magnetic, and refractory ceramics. The process involves compacting a powdered mass, usually mixed with a small amount of water or a binder, into a desired shape by applying pressure.

**Key Aspects:**

* **Compaction:** The goal is to maximize compaction and minimize void space by using a mixture of coarse and fine particles in appropriate ratios to efficiently fill the gaps.
* **Particle Deformation:** Unlike metal powders, ceramic particles typically do not undergo plastic deformation during compaction.
* **Binder:** The binder (e.g., water) helps to lubricate the powder particles, facilitating their movement and rearrangement during the compaction process.

**Types of Powder Pressing:**

There are three main powder-pressing procedures:

1.  **Uniaxial Pressing:**
    * Powder is compacted in a metal die by applying pressure in a single direction (uniaxially) using punches.
    * The formed piece takes the shape of the die cavity and the platens applying pressure.
    * This method is best suited for relatively simple shapes.
    * **Advantages:** High production rates and low cost.
    * **Process Steps (as shown in Figure 13.22):**
        * **(a)** Beginning of the cycle.
        * **(b)** The die cavity is filled with powder by a feed shoe.
        * **(c)** The powder is compacted by pressure applied to the top punch.
        * **(d)** The compacted piece is ejected by the upward movement of the bottom punch.
        * **(e)** The feed shoe pushes away the compacted piece, and the die is ready for the next fill.

2.  **Isostatic (or Hydrostatic) Pressing:**
    * The powder is enclosed in a flexible rubber envelope.
    * Pressure is applied isostatically (uniformly in all directions) through a fluid medium.
    * This technique allows for the creation of more complex shapes compared to uniaxial pressing.
    * **Disadvantages:** More time-consuming and expensive than uniaxial pressing.

3.  **Hot Pressing:**
    * Powder pressing and heat treatment (sintering) are performed simultaneously.
    * The powder is compacted at an elevated temperature.
    * **Advantages:** Used for materials that do not readily form a liquid phase except at very high temperatures and when high densities are required without significant grain growth.
    * **Disadvantages:** Expensive due to the need to heat and cool the mold and die during each cycle, longer production times, stricter controls needed, and the mold is often expensive to make and may have a limited lifespan.

**Sintering:**

For both uniaxial and isostatic pressing, a subsequent **firing operation** is necessary. During firing, the compacted piece undergoes **sintering**, a process where the powder particles coalesce to form a denser mass, leading to shrinkage, reduced porosity, and improved mechanical integrity.

* **Mechanism of Sintering (as shown in Figure 13.23):**
    * **(a)** After pressing, powder particles are in contact.
    * **(b)** During initial sintering, **necks** form at the contact points between adjacent particles, and a **grain boundary** develops within each neck. The spaces between particles become **pores**.
    * **(c)** As sintering progresses, the pores shrink and become more spherical, leading to increased density.
* **Driving Force:** The reduction in the total surface area of the particles, as surface energies are higher than grain boundary energies.
* **Temperature:** Sintering is carried out below the melting temperature of the ceramic material, typically without the presence of a liquid phase (unless liquid-phase sintering is intentionally employed for certain materials).
* **Mass Transport:** The material transport required for the changes during sintering occurs through **atomic diffusion** from the bulk of the particles to the neck regions.

###### Tape Casting

Tape casting is an important ceramic fabrication technique used to produce thin, flexible sheets or tapes. These tapes are created from a **slip**, which is similar in many respects to the slips used in slip casting.

**Slip Composition:**

The slip used in tape casting consists of:

* A suspension of **ceramic particles**.
* An **organic liquid** serving as the solvent or carrier.
* **Binders** to provide strength to the cast tape.
* **Plasticizers** to impart flexibility to the cast tape.

**Process:**

1.  The slip may undergo **de-airing** in a vacuum to remove any entrapped air or solvent vapor bubbles. These bubbles can act as stress concentration points and potential crack initiation sites in the final product.
2.  The tape is formed by pouring the slip onto a smooth, flat surface (which can be stainless steel, glass, a polymeric film, or paper).
3.  A **doctor blade** is used to spread the slip into a thin layer of uniform thickness (as shown in Figure 13.25 of the textbook).
4.  During the **drying process**, the volatile components of the slip (primarily the organic liquid) are removed through evaporation.
5.  The resulting "green" product is a flexible tape that can be easily cut or have holes punched into it before firing.
6.  The thickness of tapes produced by this method typically ranges from **0.1 to 2 mm (0.004 to 0.08 inches)**.

**Applications:**

Tape casting is widely used in the manufacturing of:

* **Ceramic substrates for integrated circuits.**
* **Multilayered capacitors.**

**Cementation:**

The textbook also briefly mentions **cementation** as another ceramic fabrication process (as illustrated in Figure 13.12). This involves mixing a cement material with water to form a paste, shaping the paste, and then allowing it to harden through complex chemical reactions. Cementation and cements are further discussed in Section 13.7 of the textbook.
