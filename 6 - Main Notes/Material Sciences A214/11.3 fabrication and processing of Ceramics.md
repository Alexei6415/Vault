# 11.3 fabrication and processing of Ceramics


### ## Glasses

#### Properties

Non-crystalline materials like glasses differ from crystalline materials in their solidification process. Instead of a sharp melting point, glasses transition continuously from a liquid to a more viscous supercooled liquid as temperature decreases. This transition is characterized by the **glass transition temperature (Tg)** or fictive temperature, where the slope of the specific volume vs. temperature curve changes slightly. Below Tg, the material is considered a glass.

Upon heating, glasses exhibit specific viscosity points important for processing:

* **Strain Point (3 × 10¹³ Pa·s):** Below this temperature, glass will fracture before any plastic deformation occurs.
* **Annealing Point (10¹² Pa·s):** At this temperature, atomic diffusion is rapid enough to relieve residual stresses within approximately 15 minutes.
* **Softening Point (4 × 10⁶ Pa·s):** This is the maximum temperature at which a glass piece can be handled without significant dimensional changes.
* **Working Point (10³ Pa·s):** The glass is easily deformed at this viscosity.
* **Melting Point (10 Pa·s):** The viscosity is low enough for the glass to be considered a fluid liquid.
* **Working Range:** The temperature range between the softening and working points is where most glass-forming operations are carried out. The specific temperatures for these points depend on the glass composition.

##### Raw Materials

Most commercial glasses are **silica-soda-lime glasses**, composed of:

* **Silica (SiO₂):** Usually supplied as quartz sand.
* **Soda (Na₂O):** Added as soda ash (Na₂CO₃).
* **Lime (CaO):** Added as limestone (CaCO₃).

For high-quality glass, especially for optical applications, it's crucial to achieve **homogeneity** through complete melting and mixing of the raw materials. **Porosity** due to gas bubbles must also be eliminated by adjusting the viscosity of the molten material.

##### Pressing

Pressing is used for fabricating relatively thick-walled glass pieces like plates and dishes. The process involves applying pressure to a gob of molten glass within a graphite-coated cast iron mold of the desired shape. The mold is typically heated to ensure a smooth surface finish.

##### Drawing

Drawing is employed to produce long glass pieces with a constant cross-section, such as sheets, rods, tubing, and fibers.

* **Float Process (Sheet Glass):** This economical process involves passing molten glass from a melting furnace onto a bath of molten tin within a controlled atmosphere furnace. The glass ribbon "floats" on the tin, allowing gravity and surface tension to create perfectly flat and parallel surfaces of uniform thickness. The sheet is then cooled, fire-polished, passed through an annealing furnace (lehr) to relieve stresses, and finally cut into sections.

* **Fiber Forming:** Continuous glass fibers are made by drawing molten glass through many small orifices at the base of a heated platinum chamber. The glass viscosity, controlled by temperature, is a critical factor in this process.

#### Heat Treatment of Glass

##### Annealing:

Annealing is performed to relieve **thermal stresses** that can be introduced during cooling due to differences in cooling rates between the surface and the interior of the glass. Faster cooling of the surface compared to the interior can lead to these stresses, which can weaken brittle ceramics like glass and potentially cause fracture (**thermal shock**). Annealing involves heating the glassware to the annealing point and then slowly cooling it to room temperature to eliminate or reduce these stresses.

##### Glass Tempering

Glass tempering, also known as **thermal tempering**, is a heat treatment used to significantly increase the strength of a glass piece. This is achieved by intentionally inducing **compressive residual stresses** on the surface of the glass.

**Thermal Tempering Process:**

1.  The glassware is heated to a temperature above the glass transition region but below the softening point.
2.  It is then rapidly cooled to room temperature using jets of air (or sometimes an oil bath).

**Mechanism:** The surface cools and becomes rigid more quickly than the interior. As the interior continues to cool and attempts to contract, the rigid surface restricts this contraction, resulting in compressive stresses on the surface and tensile stresses in the interior. Because cracks in brittle materials typically initiate at the surface due to tensile stresses, the compressive surface stress in tempered glass must first be overcome by an external tensile force before a crack can form and propagate. This makes tempered glass much stronger than untempered glass. It is used in applications requiring high strength, such as large doors and eyeglass lenses.

#### Why worry about ceramic processing

* **High Melting Point:** Ceramics generally have very high melting points, making casting difficult compared to metals.
* **Very Brittle:** Ceramics are typically brittle and lack ductility, making forming through plastic deformation challenging.

The processing methods for ceramics vary depending on the specific type of ceramic.

## Clay products:
#### Properties
Aluminosilicates: alumina (Al2O3), silica(SiO2) and chemically-bound H2O
Layered crystal structure
water molecules allow sliding of clay particles: hydro-plasticity 
Fuses/melts over a range of temperatures: retains shape during firing

#### Fabrication techniques
###### Hydro-plastic forming:
Mixed with water: plastic and pliable
Low yield strength but enough to maintain shape during handling and drying
extrude into shape.

###### Slip casting
Slip : suspension of clay and/or non plastic materials in water
porous mould - plaster of paris
Slip water absorbed into mould until
	whole cavity is solid(solid casting)
	wall of cast shell reaches desired thickness by pouring out excess slip (drain casting)

###### Drying
liquid removed -> green body
shrinkage occurs -> cracking/ warpage
	surface evaporation should be <= interior diffusion
	reduce thickness
	keep water content in slip low
	increase particle size/add large non-plastic particles

###### Firing
Green body heated at 900-1400 deg C.
improves density and strength of green body.


###### Vitrification: formation of glassy liquid phase that fills pore volumes through capillary action.
cooling forms a glassy matrix.
higher temperatures -> higher degree of vitrification (fluxing agent) 
	Bricks fired at 900 deg C -> porous.
	Optically translucent porcelain fired at 1200 deg C -> very dense


###### powder pressing
like powder metallurgy of metals.
powder binded by water is compacted into desired shape.
	particles are various sizes to fill voids.
	binder (e.g. water) lubricates powder for compaction.
Sintering: coalescence of powder particles to improve density of isostatic and uniaxially pressed products.

Compacting + sintering
ADVANTAGES:
	used for materials that form liquid phases at too high of temperatures.
	high densities without grain growth.
DISADVANTAGES:
expensive, longer production times, stricter controls needed, limited mould life.

###### Tape casting
Slip: ceramic particles in an organic liquid with binders and plasticizers
