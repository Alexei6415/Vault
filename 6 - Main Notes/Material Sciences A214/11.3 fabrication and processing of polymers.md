# 11.3 fabrication and processing of polymers

### Why worry about ceramic processing
High melting point -> difficult to cast
very brittle -> cannot be formed through plastic deformation


Different ways depending on their ceramic type

## Glasses
#### Properties
Non-crystalline glasses do not cool like crystalline materials
Supercooled glass liquid: very viscous

upon heating:
- Strain point (3x10^13 Pa.s): fracture below this
- Annealing point(10^12Pa.s): relieve stresses
- Softening point (4x10^6Pa.s): handling causes dimensional changes beyond this 
- working point (1000Pa.s): easily deformed
- Melting point(10Pa.s):Molten liquid
- Working range: between the softening and working temperatures - forming process

##### Raw materials
(silica-soda-lime glasses): silica quartz soda-ash and limestone

##### Pressing
pressed glass processing:

##### Drawing
float process, molten glass it passed on rollers with tin, forms very flat panes of glass which are annealed then cut to shape

can also make glass fibres where they are pulled through tiny holes in the bottom of a furnace.

#### Heat treatment of glass
##### Annealing:
relieves thermal stresses: faster cooling(surface) vs slower cooling (interior)

##### Glass tempering
Thermal Tempering: increases glass strength
compressive residual stresses on surface


## Clay products:
#### Properties
Aluminosilicates: alumina (Al2O3), silica(SiO2) and chemically-bound H2O
Layered crystal structure
water molecules allow sliding of clay particles: hydro-plasticity 
Fuses/melts over a range of temperatures: retains shape during firing

#### Fabrication techniques
###### Hydro-plastic forming:
Mixed with water: plastic and pliable
Low yield strength but enough to maintain shape during handling and drying
extrude into shape.

###### Slip casting
Slip : suspension of clay and/or non plastic materials in water
porous mould - plaster of paris
Slip water absorbed into mould until
	whole cavity is solid(solid casting)
	wall of cast shell reaches desired thickness by pouring out excess slip (drain casting)

###### Drying
liquid removed -> green body
shrinkage occurs -> cracking/ warpage
	surface evaporation should be <= interior diffusion
	reduce thickness
	keep water content in slip low
	increase particle size/add large non-plastic particles

###### Firing
Green body heated at 900-1400 deg C.
improves density and strength of green body.


###### Vitrification: formation of glassy liquid phase that fills pore volumes through capillary action.
cooling forms a glassy matrix.
higher temperatures -> higher degree of vitrification (fluxing agent) 
	Bricks fired at 900 deg C -> porous.
	Optically translucent porcelain fired at 1200 deg C -> very dense


###### powder pressing
like powder metallurgy of metals.
powder binded by water is compacted into desired shape.
	particles are various sizes to fill voids.
	binder (e.g. water) lubricates powder for compaction.
Sintering: coalescence of powder particles to improve density of isostatic and uniaxially pressed products.

Compacting + sintering
ADVANTAGES:
	used for materials that form liquid phases at too high of temperatures.
	high densities without grain growth.
DISADVANTAGES:
expensive, longer production times, stricter controls needed, limited mould life.

###### Tape casting
Slip: ceramic particles in an organic liquid with binders and plasticizers
