# 3.3 Diffusion

Definition : Diffusion is the mass transport of material from one position to another driven by atomic motion.

Diffusion couple - When 2 materials ( like metals) will diffuse into one another and make a solid solution

[[Interdiffusion]] : Atoms of one metal move into another, observable as changes in concentration (e.g., copper and nickel diffusion couple). It involves net atomic movement from high- to low-concentration areas.
[[Self-diffusion]] : Atoms of the same type exchange places in pure metals, though compositional changes are not noticeable.

Factors like temperature and the diffusing species influence diffusion rates, and mathematical models describe its behaviour.

## Diffusion Mechanics
Diffusion in solids involves the stepwise migration of atoms between lattice sites. For this to occur, two conditions must be met: (1) an adjacent site must be vacant, and (2) the atom must have enough vibrational energy to break its bonds and overcome lattice distortions. Atoms in solids are constantly moving, and as temperature rises, a greater fraction of atoms gain sufficient energy for diffusive motion. Various models explain atomic motion, with two main ones for metallic diffusion.

[[Vacancy]] Diffusion - when atoms fill a [[vacancy]] - Must be a vacancy to fill*
Substitution Diffusion - When atoms swap positions with each other.


[[Interstitial]] Diffusion - when atoms force there way through interstitial positions of a [[Crystal lattice]]

In most metal alloys, interstitial diffusion occurs much more rapidly than diffusion by the vacancy mode, because the interstitial atoms are smaller and thus more mobile. Furthermore, there are more empty interstitial positions than vacancies; hence, the probability of interstitial atomic movement is greater than for vacancy diffusion.

Engineering Applications 
- Case Hardening - Interstitial diffusion of carbon atoms into outer layer of steel.
- Doping - P-type semiconductor

## Fick's First law
- How fast does Diffusion Occur?
- What is the flux, J, or mass transfer rate, kg/m^2.s 
J = M/At - Mass, M [kg] transferring through an area, A [m^2] over an amount of time, t [s]

Diffusion is the time-dependent movement of an element within another, often measured by the diffusion flux (J), representing the mass or number of atoms transported through a unit area per unit time. The rate of diffusion depends on the concentration gradient, as per Fick's first law, where the diffusion coefficient (D) is the proportionality constant. This process moves down the concentration gradient (high to low concentration).

Steady-state diffusion occurs when the diffusion flux remains constant over time, meaning the mass entering equals the mass exiting, with no net accumulation. The concentration profile in this state is linear, and the concentration gradient is the driving force. A real-world application of steady-state diffusion is the purification of hydrogen gas using a palladium metal sheet, where hydrogen selectively diffuses through the sheet.

Assumptions :
1. at a given temperature therefore D is constant 
2. dC/dx is constant

Driving force : concentration gradient
J = -D dC/dx - Flux, J [kg/m^2.s] is controlled by the diffusion coefficient , D[m^2/s] and dependent of the change in concentration, dC[kg/m^3] over distance, dx[m], in the solid

Diffusion flux j and concentration gradient changes with time.

Implication : the concentration of the diffusing species is a function of both position, x and time, t.



## Fick's Second law - Non-Steady State diffusion
The discussion focuses on **[[non-steady-state diffusion]]**, where the diffusion flux and concentration gradient change over time, resulting in a net accumulation or depletion of the diffusing species. This scenario is governed by **[[Fick's Second Law]]**, represented by the partial differential equation:

$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left(D \frac{\partial C}{\partial x} \right)$

For cases where the diffusion coefficient DD is constant, this simplifies to:

$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}$

This equation requires appropriate boundary conditions and initial conditions for solutions. A notable example involves a **semi-infinite solid** where:

1. The initial concentration is uniform (C0).
    
2. Surface concentration is constant (Cs).
    
3. Diffusion begins at t=0.
    

Under these conditions, the concentration at depth x and time t can be calculated using:

$\frac{C_x - C_0}{C_s - C_0} = 1 - \text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{2\sqrt{Dt}}\right)$

where "erf" denotes the Gaussian error function.

**Practical Examples:**

1. Steady-state diffusion: Hydrogen gas purification using palladium.
    
2. Driving forces: Concentration gradients or other forces involved in phase transformations.




## Factors that influence Diffusion
- Diffusing Species
	Both the host material and the atoms that are diffusion into it define the rate of diffusion, as indicated by the diffusion coefficient, D
- Temperature:
	The diffusion coefficient , D is highly dependent on the temperature, T.

## Diffusion in Semiconducting materials
- **IC Basics:** Integrated circuits are small silicon chips, approximately 6 mm x 6 mm x 0.4 mm, containing millions of interconnected electronic devices. Precise impurities are introduced to specific regions of the silicon to make these devices functional.
    
- **Diffusion Process:**
    
    - **Pre-deposition:** Impurity atoms are diffused into silicon at a temperature of 900-1000°C for under an hour. The impurity concentration is constant at the surface and follows a predictable pattern.
        
    - **Drive-In Diffusion:** Impurities are further diffused at higher temperatures (~1200°C) to achieve a suitable concentration distribution. This is done in an oxidizing atmosphere to form a surface oxide layer that limits impurity escape.
        
- **Modern Use:** For high-density ICs, ion beam implantation is preferred over diffusion for greater precision. However, diffusion is still used for low-density devices like solar panels.
    
- **Mathematics & Parameters:** Equations (based on Fick's Laws) describe the impurity concentration over time and space, including terms for total impurities, surface concentration, and diffusion coefficients. Junction depth, the depth where impurity concentration matches the background level, is also calculated.
    

In essence, diffusion techniques allow for controlled placement of impurities in silicon to build functioning IC devices.

## Other Diffusion paths
Atomic migration may also occur along dislocations, grain boundaries, and external surfaces. These are sometimes called short-circuit diffusion paths inasmuch as rates are much faster than for bulk diffusion. However, in most situations, short-circuit contributions to the overall diffusion flux are insignificant because the cross-sectional areas of these paths are extremely small.

## Summary
SUMMARY 
• Solid-state diffusion is a means of mass transport within solid materials by stepwise atomic motion. 
• The term interdiffusion refers to the migration of impurity atoms; for host atoms, the term self-diffusion is used.
• Two mechanisms for diffusion are possible: vacancy and interstitial. Vacancy diffusion occurs via the exchange of an atom residing on a normal lattice site with an adjacent vacancy. For interstitial diffusion, an atom migrates from one interstitial position to an empty adjacent one.
• For a given host metal, interstitial atomic species generally diffuse more rapidly.
• Diffusion flux is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient according to Fick’s first law, Equation 5.2.
• The diffusion condition for which the flux is independent of time is known as steady state.
• The driving force for steady-state diffusion is the concentration gradient (dC/dx). 
• For nonsteady-state diffusion, there is a net accumulation or depletion of diffusing species, and the flux is dependent on time. 
• The mathematics for nonsteady state in a single (x) direction (and when the diffusion coefficient is independent of concentration) may be described by Fick’s second law, Equation 5.4b. 
• For a constant surface composition boundary condition, the solution to Fick’s second law (Equation 5.4b) is Equation 5.5, which involves the Gaussian error function (erf). 
• The magnitude of the diffusion coefficient is indicative of the rate of atomic motion and depends on both host and diffusing species as well as on temperature. 
• The diffusion coefficient is a function of temperature according to Equation 5.8.
• The two heat treatments that are used to diffuse impurities into silicon during inte- grated circuit fabrication are predeposition and drive-in. During predeposition, impurity atoms are diffused into the silicon, often from a gas phase, the partial pressure of which is maintained constant. For the drive-in step, impurity atoms are transported deeper into the silicon so as to provide a more suitable concentration distribution without increasing the overall impurity content.
• Integrated circuit interconnects are normally made of aluminium—instead of metals such as copper, silver, and gold that have higher electrical conductivities—on the basis of diffusion considerations. During high-temperature heat treatments, interconnect metal atoms diffuse into the silicon; appreciable concentrations will compromise the chip’s functionality.
