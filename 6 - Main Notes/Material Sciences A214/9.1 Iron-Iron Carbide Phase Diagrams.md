# 9.1 Iron-Iron Carbide Phase Diagrams

Iron Carbide represents most steels and Cast irons.

### Facts
##### Fact 1
Iron has 2 allotropes, Fe2( Ferrite) aka alpha iron which @ room temp has a BCC.
	Austenite ( gamma Iron) @ > 912 deg C has a FCC.
##### Fact 2
Solubility limits of C in Fe
	alpha-Fe ( ferrite) - less space for carbon interstitials therefore low solubility, 0.022 wt% @ 727 deg C
	Gamma-Fe(Austenite) - FCC so more space so 2,14% wt% C @ 1147 deg C 
##### Fact 3
Intermediate compound
Fe3C - cementite
	combination of iron and carbon - ceramic.
	Fe3C : 3Fe+ + C3-
	due to difference in atomic weights, 6.70 wt% C
	ionic bond, ceramic --> strong
##### Fact 4
Eutectic @ 1147 deg C
4.3 wt% C -> gamma + Fe3C(2.14 wt% C) (6.7 wt% C)

##### Fact 5
Eutectoid @ 727 deg C
gamma -> ferrite + Fe3C

# 9.2 drawing the iron iron carbide phase diagram
at 0% wt C we have pure carbon. must use the 5 facts to be able to draw.

### Eutectoid Composition

 When cooling occurs at the Eutectoid composition, this is the Eutectoid compositions, when above the Eutectoid temperature it is entirely the Gamma or Austenite composition, and when it cools it forms the alpha + Fe3C composition, you can clearly identify the grains present in the Eutectic composition also called Pearlite

### Hypoeutectoid Composition

When both the Alpha and Austenite Phases are present. 

at point D parts of the Alpha begin to form amongst the Austenite
at point E more begins to form.
at Point F it has passed through the Eutectic temperature so the Austenite is replaced with Pearlite which is composed of the Eutectoid Alpha and Fe3C
the remaining alpha from before is considered to be Proeutectoid alpha.

### Nonequilibrium cooling
almost all situations are occurring slow enough that cooling is at equilibrium.

### Influence of other alloying elements
Shifts the Eutectoid point left or right depending on which alloy is added
