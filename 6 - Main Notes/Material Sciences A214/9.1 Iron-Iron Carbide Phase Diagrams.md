### Facts
##### Fact 1
Iron has 2 allotropes, Fe2( Ferrite) aka alpha iron which @ room temp has a BCC.
	Austenite ( gamma Iron) @ > 912 deg C has a FCC.
##### Fact 2
Solubility limits of C in Fe
	alpha-Fe ( ferrite) - less space for carbon interstitials therefore low solubility, 0.022 wt% @ 727 deg C
	Gamma-Fe(Austenite) - FCC so more space so 2,14% wt% C @ 1147 deg C 
##### Fact 3
Intermediate compound
Fe3C - cementite
	combination of iron and carbon - ceramic.
	Fe3C : 3Fe+ + C3-
	due to difference in atomic weights, 6.70 wt% C
	ionic bond, ceramic --> strong
##### Fact 4
Eutectic @ 1147 deg C
4.3 wt% C -> gamma + Fe3C(2.14 wt% C) (6.7 wt% C)

##### Fact 5
Eutectoid @ 727 deg C
gamma -> ferrite + Fe3C


### Alpha Ferrite
only at < 0.22 wt% C
is relatively soft, can be made magnetic at lower temperatures and has a density of 7.88 g/cm^3

### Gamma Iron - Austenite
Not Stable below 727 deg C
has a maximum solubility of 2.14 wt% C(Approximately 100x greater than Ferrite).

### Cementite
Only forms when the solubility limit of carbon in alpha ferrite is exceeded below 727 deg C
Also exists above 727 deg C with austenite
Very hard and brittle, the strength of some steel is enhanced by its presence.

- **Cementite is Metastable:** Strictly speaking, cementite is not a truly stable equilibrium compound. It's **metastable**, meaning it will persist indefinitely at room temperature, but given enough time at higher temperatures, it will eventually change.  
    
- **Slow Decomposition at Elevated Temperatures:** If steel containing cementite is heated to between 650°C and 700°C for several years, the cementite will gradually decompose into **alpha-ferrite (α-iron)** and **carbon in the form of graphite**. This graphite will remain even after the steel cools back to room temperature.  
    
- **Practical Use of the Fe-Fe₃C Diagram:** Because the rate of this decomposition of cementite is extremely slow under most conditions, the **iron–iron carbide phase diagram** (which includes cementite) is considered valid and very useful for practical purposes concerning steel. In almost all steels, the carbon exists as Fe₃C rather than graphite.  
    
- **Silicon Accelerates Decomposition in Cast Irons:** The addition of silicon to cast irons speeds up the decomposition of cementite into graphite. This is why graphite is commonly found in cast irons (as mentioned in Section 11.2, which we will likely cover later).  

- **Eutectic Reaction:** The Fe–Fe₃C system has a eutectic reaction occurring at **4.30 wt% C** and **1147°C (2097°F)**. Upon cooling, the liquid phase transforms into austenite (γ) and cementite (Fe₃C):
    
    ```
    L  ⇌  γ + Fe₃C
    cooling
    heating
    ```
    
- **Eutectoid Reaction:** There is also a eutectoid invariant point at **0.76 wt% C** and **727°C (1341°F)**. The eutectoid reaction is:  
    
    ```
    γ(0.76 wt% C)  ⇌  α(0.022 wt% C) + Fe₃C(6.7 wt% C)
    cooling
    heating
    ```
    
    This means that upon cooling, the solid austenite (γ) phase transforms into ferrite (α-iron) and cementite. This reaction is fundamental to the heat treatment of steels.
    
- **Classification of Ferrous Alloys based on Carbon Content:** Ferrous alloys are primarily made of iron with carbon as a key alloying element. They are classified into three types based on their carbon content:  
    
    - **Iron (Commercially Pure):** Contains less than **0.008 wt% C**. According to the phase diagram, it is almost entirely ferrite (α) at room temperature.  
        
    - **Steel:** Contains between **0.008 and 2.14 wt% C**. The microstructure of most steels consists of both ferrite (α) and cementite (Fe₃C). During cooling from high temperatures, these alloys pass through the austenite (γ) phase field, which leads to characteristic microstructures. In practice, the carbon content in steels rarely exceeds 1.0 wt%.  
        
    - **Cast Iron:** Contains between **2.14 and 6.70 wt% C**. However, commercially used cast irons typically have less than 4.5 wt% C.

### Eutectoid Composition
![[Pasted image 20250407174835.png]]
 When cooling occurs at the Eutectoid composition,0.76wt% C, when above the Eutectoid temperature it is entirely the Gamma or Austenite composition, and when it cools it forms the alpha + Fe3C composition, you can clearly identify the grains present in the Eutectic composition also called Pearlite, it gets this name because it represents the mother of pearl. These alternating layers/lamellae of Ferrite and Cementite has a thickness ratio of 8 to 1. Pearlite exists as grains(colonies) where the regions have different orientations. Pearlite has intermediate properties between the soft ferrite and the hard brittle cementite.

### Hypoeutectoid Composition
![[Pasted image 20250407175459.png]]

When both the Alpha and Austenite Phases are present. 

at point D parts of the Alpha begin to form amongst the Austenite
at point E more begins to form.
at Point F it has passed through the Eutectic temperature so the Austenite is replaced with Pearlite which is composed of the Eutectoid Alpha and Fe3C
the remaining alpha from before is considered to be Proeutectoid alpha.

If we want to calculate the relative amounts of each product:
- **Lever Rule Application:** Similar to how primary and eutectic microconstituents were calculated earlier, the lever rule is used here.
    
- **Tie Line for Calculation:** The relevant tie line extends across the α + pearlite region, specifically from the maximum solubility of carbon in ferrite (0.022 wt% C) to the eutectoid composition (0.76 wt% C), as pearlite forms from austenite of this eutectoid composition.
    
- **Fraction of Pearlite (Wp):** For an alloy with an overall carbon composition C₀' (less than 0.76 wt% C), the weight fraction of pearlite (Wp) is given by the lever rule as:
    
    ```
   Wp = T/(T + U) = Wp = (C₀' - 0.022) / (0.76 - 0.022) = (C₀' - 0.022) / 0.74
    ```
    
- **Fraction of Proeutectoid α (Wα'):** The weight fraction of proeutectoid ferrite (Wα') is calculated as:
    
    ```
    Wa' = U/(T+U) = Wα' = (0.76 - C₀') / (0.76 - 0.022) = (0.76 - C₀') / 0.74
    ```
    

In essence, the lever rule helps determine the proportions of these two microconstituents based on the overall carbon content of the steel alloy.

### Hypereutectoid Composition
![[Pasted image 20250407180604.png]]
- **Initial State (Point g):** When the hypereutectoid steel is at a high temperature within the γ phase field, it consists entirely of austenite grains with the overall alloy composition (C1).
    
- **Formation of Proeutectoid Cementite (Point h):** As the alloy cools into the γ + Fe₃C two-phase region, **proeutectoid cementite** begins to form. This cementite precipitates out along the grain boundaries of the original austenite grains. The composition of the cementite is always 6.70 wt% C. As cementite forms, the composition of the remaining austenite shifts along the phase boundary towards the eutectoid composition (0.76 wt% C).
    
- **Formation of Pearlite (Point i):** When the temperature reaches the eutectoid temperature (727°C), the remaining austenite, which has now reached the eutectoid composition, undergoes the eutectoid reaction and transforms into **pearlite**. Pearlite is a lamellar (layered) mixture of ferrite (α) and cementite (Fe₃C).
    
- **Final Microstructure:** The final microstructure of a slowly cooled hypereutectoid steel consists of **pearlite** and the **proeutectoid cementite** that formed earlier along the austenite grain boundaries. In a micrograph (like Figure 9.33 of a 1.4 wt% C steel), the proeutectoid cementite appears as light areas surrounding the pearlite.
    
- **Distinguishing Microstructures:** The passage notes that proeutectoid cementite can look similar to proeutectoid ferrite (which forms in hypoeutectoid steels), making it sometimes challenging to differentiate between hypoeutectoid and hypereutectoid steels based solely on their microstructure.


Thus to calculate the compositions of pearlite and Cementite
Wp = X/(V + X) = (6.70 - C'1)/(6.7 - 0.76) = (6.7-C'1)/5.94

W(Fe3C) = V/(V + X) = (C'1 - 0.76)/(6.7 - 0.76) = (C'1 - 0.76)/5.94

### Nonequilibrium cooling
- **Metastable Equilibrium Assumption:** The explanations so far have assumed that cooling was slow enough to maintain **metastable equilibrium**. This means that at each temperature, the phases had enough time to adjust their compositions and relative amounts as predicted by the Fe–Fe₃C phase diagram.
    
- **Impracticality of Slow Cooling:** In practice, such slow cooling rates are often **impractical** and sometimes even **unnecessary**.
    
- **Non-Equilibrium Effects in Reality:** When cooling occurs faster (non-equilibrium conditions), two main effects can be observed:
    
    1. **Phase transformations can occur at temperatures that are different** from those indicated by the phase boundary lines on the equilibrium diagram.
        
    2. **Non-equilibrium phases** that are not even present on the Fe–Fe₃C equilibrium phase diagram can exist at room temperature.
        
- **Further Discussion in Chapter 10:** These important effects of non-equilibrium conditions will be explored in more detail in Chapter 10 (which we will likely discuss later).

### Influence of other alloying elements
This passage explains how adding other alloying elements to iron can change the iron–iron carbide phase diagram:

- **Dramatic Changes:** Adding elements like chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), and titanium (Ti) causes significant changes to the **iron–iron carbide phase diagram** (Figure 9.24).
    
- **Altered Phase Boundaries and Fields:** The positions of the lines separating different phases and the shapes of the areas where specific phases are stable are altered.
    
- **Eutectoid Shift:** One important change is the shift in the **eutectoid point**, which is defined by both temperature and carbon concentration. The extent of this shift depends on the type and amount of the added alloying element. Figures 9.34 and 9.35 (not shown) illustrate how different alloying elements affect the eutectoid temperature and composition (in weight percent carbon).
    
- **Impact on Pearlite and Proeutectoid Phase:** These alterations mean that the temperature at which the eutectoid reaction occurs changes, and also the relative amounts (fractions) of **pearlite** and the **proeutectoid phase** that form during cooling will be different compared to plain carbon steels.
    
- **Main Reasons for Alloying Steels:** Despite these changes to the phase diagram, the main reasons for adding alloying elements to steels are usually to:
    
    - **Improve their corrosion resistance** (make them more resistant to rusting).
        
    - **Make them more amenable to heat treatment** (allow for a wider range of microstructures and properties to be achieved through heating and cooling processes), as will be discussed later in Section 11.8.

## SUMMARY

* Equilibrium phase diagrams are a convenient and concise way of representing the most stable relationships between phases in alloy systems.
* A phase is some portion of a body of material throughout which the physical and chemical characteristics are homogeneous.
* Three microstructural characteristics that are important for multiphase alloys are:
    * The number of phases present
    * The relative proportions of the phases
    * The manner in which the phases are arranged
* Three factors affect the microstructure of an alloy:
    * What alloying elements are present
    * The concentrations of these alloying elements
    * The heat treatment of the alloy
* A system at equilibrium is in its most stable state—that is, its phase characteristics do not change over time.
* Metastable systems are nonequilibrium ones that persist indefinitely and experience imperceptible changes with time.
* For one-component phase diagrams, the logarithm of the pressure is plotted versus the temperature; solid-, liquid-, and vapor-phase regions are found on this type of diagram.
* For binary systems, temperature and composition are variables, whereas external pressure is held constant. Areas, or phase regions, are defined on these temperature- versus-composition plots within which either one or two phases exist.
* Isomorphous diagrams are those for which there is complete solubility in the solid phase; the copper–nickel system (Figure 9.3a) displays this behaviour.
* For an alloy of specified composition at a known temperature and that is at equilibrium, the following may be determined:
    * What phase(s) is (are) present—from the location of the temperature–composition point on the phase diagram.
    * Phase composition(s)—a horizontal tie line is used for the two-phase situation.
    * Phase mass fraction(s)—the lever rule [which uses tie-line segment lengths (Equations 9.1 and 9.2)] is used in two-phase regions.
* In a eutectic reaction, as found in some alloy systems, a liquid phase transforms isothermally into two different solid phases upon cooling (i.e., L → 𝛼 + 𝛽).
* The solubility limit at some temperature corresponds to the maximum concentration of one component that will go into solution in a specific phase. For a binary eutectic system, solubility limits are to be found along solidus and solvus phase boundaries.
* The solidification of an alloy (liquid) of eutectic composition yields a microstructure consisting of layers of the two solid phases that alternate.
* A primary (or pre-eutectic) phase and the layered eutectic structure are the solidification products for all compositions (other than the eutectic) that lie along the eutectic isotherm.
* Other equilibrium diagrams are more complex, in that they may have phases/solid solutions/compounds that do not lie at the concentration (i.e., horizontal) extremes on the diagram. These include intermediate solid solutions and intermetallic compounds.
* In addition to the eutectic, other invariant reactions involving three phases may occur at specific points on a phase diagram:
    * For a eutectoid reaction, upon cooling, one solid phase transforms into two other solid phases (e.g., 𝛼 → 𝛽 + 𝛾).
    * For a peritectic reaction, upon cooling, a liquid and one solid phase transform into another solid phase (e.g., L + 𝛼 → 𝛽).
* A transformation in which there is no change in composition for the phases involved is congruent.
* The Gibbs phase rule is a simple equation (Equation 9.16 in its most general form) that relates the number of phases present in a system at equilibrium with the number of degrees of freedom, the number of components, and the number of non compositional variables.
* Important phases found on the iron–iron carbide phase diagram (Figure 9.24) are:
    * 𝛼-ferrite (BCC)
    * 𝛾-austenite (FCC)
    * The intermetallic compound iron carbide [or cementite (Fe₃C)]
* On the basis of composition, ferrous alloys fall into three classifications:
    * Irons (<0.008 wt% C)
    * Steels (0.008 to 2.14 wt% C)
    * Cast irons (>2.14 wt% C)
* The development of microstructure for many iron–carbon alloys and steels depends on a eutectoid reaction in which the austenite phase of composition 0.76 wt% C transforms isothermally (at 727°C) into 𝛼-ferrite (0.022 wt% C) and cementite (i.e., 𝛾 → 𝛼 + Fe₃C).
* The microstructural product of an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoid composition is pearlite, a microconstituent consisting of alternating layers of ferrite and cementite.
* The microstructures of alloys having carbon contents less than the eutectoid (i.e., hypoeutectoid alloys) are composed of a proeutectoid ferrite phase in addition to pearlite.
* Pearlite and proeutectoid cementite constitute the microconstituents for hypereutectoid alloys—those with carbon contents in excess of the eutectoid composition.
