# 9.1 Iron-Iron Carbide Phase Diagrams

Iron Carbide represents most steels and Cast irons.

### Facts
##### Fact 1
Iron has 2 allotropes, Fe2( Ferrite) aka alpha iron which @ room temp has a BCC.
	Austenite ( gamma Iron) @ > 912 deg C has a FCC.
##### Fact 2
Solubility limits of C in Fe
	alpha-Fe ( ferrite) - less space for carbon interstitials therefore low solubility, 0.022 wt% @ 727 deg C
	Gamma-Fe(Austenite) - FCC so more space so 2,14% wt% C @ 1147 deg C 
##### Fact 3
Intermediate compound
Fe3C - cementite
	combination of iron and carbon - ceramic.
	Fe3C : 3Fe+ + C3-
	due to difference in atomic weights, 6.70 wt% C
	ionic bond, ceramic --> strong
##### Fact 4
Eutectic @ 1147 deg C
4.3 wt% C -> gamma + Fe3C(2.14 wt% C) (6.7 wt% C)

##### Fact 5
Eutectoid @ 727 deg C
gamma -> ferrite + Fe3C


### Alpha Ferrite
only at < 0.22 wt% C
is relatively soft, can be made magnetic at lower temperatures and has a density of 7.88 g/cm^3

### Gamma Iron - Austenite
Not Stable below 727 deg C
has a maximum solubility of 2.14 wt% C(Approximately 100x greater than Ferrite).

### Cementite
Only forms when the solubility limit of carbon in alpha ferrite is exceeded below 727 deg C
Also exists above 727 deg C with austenite
Very hard and brittle, the strength of some steel is enhanced by its presence.

- **Cementite is Metastable:** Strictly speaking, cementite is not a truly stable equilibrium compound. It's **metastable**, meaning it will persist indefinitely at room temperature, but given enough time at higher temperatures, it will eventually change.  
    
- **Slow Decomposition at Elevated Temperatures:** If steel containing cementite is heated to between 650°C and 700°C for several years, the cementite will gradually decompose into **alpha-ferrite (α-iron)** and **carbon in the form of graphite**. This graphite will remain even after the steel cools back to room temperature.  
    
- **Practical Use of the Fe-Fe₃C Diagram:** Because the rate of this decomposition of cementite is extremely slow under most conditions, the **iron–iron carbide phase diagram** (which includes cementite) is considered valid and very useful for practical purposes concerning steel. In almost all steels, the carbon exists as Fe₃C rather than graphite.  
    
- **Silicon Accelerates Decomposition in Cast Irons:** The addition of silicon to cast irons speeds up the decomposition of cementite into graphite. This is why graphite is commonly found in cast irons (as mentioned in Section 11.2, which we will likely cover later).  

- **Eutectic Reaction:** The Fe–Fe₃C system has a eutectic reaction occurring at **4.30 wt% C** and **1147°C (2097°F)**. Upon cooling, the liquid phase transforms into austenite (γ) and cementite (Fe₃C):
    
    ```
    L  ⇌  γ + Fe₃C
    cooling
    heating
    ```
    
- **Eutectoid Reaction:** There is also a eutectoid invariant point at **0.76 wt% C** and **727°C (1341°F)**. The eutectoid reaction is:  
    
    ```
    γ(0.76 wt% C)  ⇌  α(0.022 wt% C) + Fe₃C(6.7 wt% C)
    cooling
    heating
    ```
    
    This means that upon cooling, the solid austenite (γ) phase transforms into ferrite (α-iron) and cementite. This reaction is fundamental to the heat treatment of steels.
    
- **Classification of Ferrous Alloys based on Carbon Content:** Ferrous alloys are primarily made of iron with carbon as a key alloying element. They are classified into three types based on their carbon content:  
    
    - **Iron (Commercially Pure):** Contains less than **0.008 wt% C**. According to the phase diagram, it is almost entirely ferrite (α) at room temperature.  
        
    - **Steel:** Contains between **0.008 and 2.14 wt% C**. The microstructure of most steels consists of both ferrite (α) and cementite (Fe₃C). During cooling from high temperatures, these alloys pass through the austenite (γ) phase field, which leads to characteristic microstructures. In practice, the carbon content in steels rarely exceeds 1.0 wt%.  
        
    - **Cast Iron:** Contains between **2.14 and 6.70 wt% C**. However, commercially used cast irons typically have less than 4.5 wt% C.

at 0% wt C we have pure carbon. must use the 5 facts to be able to draw.

### Eutectoid Composition
![[Pasted image 20250407174835.png]]
 When cooling occurs at the Eutectoid composition, this is the Eutectoid compositions, when above the Eutectoid temperature it is entirely the Gamma or Austenite composition, and when it cools it forms the alpha + Fe3C composition, you can clearly identify the grains present in the Eutectic composition also called Pearlite

### Hypoeutectoid Composition
![[Pasted image 20250407175459.png]]

When both the Alpha and Austenite Phases are present. 

at point D parts of the Alpha begin to form amongst the Austenite
at point E more begins to form.
at Point F it has passed through the Eutectic temperature so the Austenite is replaced with Pearlite which is composed of the Eutectoid Alpha and Fe3C
the remaining alpha from before is considered to be Proeutectoid alpha.

### Hypereutectoid Composition

### Nonequilibrium cooling
almost all situations are occurring slow enough that cooling is at equilibrium.

### Influence of other alloying elements
Shifts the Eutectoid point left or right depending on which alloy is added
