# Metals Summary
### Classification of metals
Ferrous vs non ferrous
![[Pasted image 20250505093416.png]]

##### Steels
Low alloy vs high alloy steel
	Low alloy steels are from 0 - 1.4 wt% C and high alloy is anything with even more or additional additives (other metals etc.).
	Low Carbon is <0.25 wt %
	Medium Carbon steel is 0.25 - 0.6 wt % C
		High Carbon is 0.6 wt% - 1.4 wt %

###### Low Carbon Steel
Plain is just iron and carbon
HSLA has additives like Cr, V, Ni, Mo
is the weakest of all carbon steels, but has the highest ductility
is better to strengthen with cold work then heat treatment as the centre/core cannot form martensite due to the incredibly fast required cooling rates to achieve martensite

###### Medium carbon steel
More heat treatable than than low carbon steel but still not the greatest,
add alloys to shift the curve to allow for martensite to form
Most tempered martensite is formed with medium carbon steels
It is less ductile and stronger than low carbon steels

Used in crankshafts and gears in automotive industry


###### High Carbon Steel
Strongest but least ductile of carbon steels
Most heat treatable:
	Hardened and tempered 
	Wear resistance, sharp cutting edge


###### High Alloy 
Has a high wt % Cr and other alloys
Stainless steel is most common example ( at least 11 wt% chromium)
	corrosion resistant
3 Types of stainless steel
1. Martensitic 
	Heat treated ( quench )
	Magnetic
2. Ferritic
	not heat treatable, strengthen by cold working
	Magnetic
3. Austenitic
	Alloy additions extend gamma phase to room temperature
	Most corrosion resistant ( high cr wt %, also Ni)
	not heat treatable, strengthen by cold working

#### Cast Irons
Have a high wt % C ( > 2.4 wt %)

###### Grey Iron
Least expensive metal
has graphite flakes embedded in the ferrite/pearlite matrix
At moderate cooling Pearlite is formed as it is not cooled slow enough for ferrite to form 
Weak and brittle under tension
Strong under compression
Wear resistant
Easily cast into complex shapes
Excellent vibration dampening

Adding Mg or Ce influences microstructure
	Graphite flakes turn into nodules/spheres
	Matrix often pearlite(due to moderate cooling) - stronger but less ductile
The added Alloys are stronger and more ductile than grey irons
used in Gears, pump bodies, crankshaft

###### White Iron
When silicon is added
forms white iron
Rapid cooling means more cementite
Very hard, wear resistant, but brittle with poor machinability
Uses : rollers in rolling mills

Rather used as an intermediate iron
	Cementite decomposes to form graphite rosettes
	in ferrite/pearlite matrix
		more ductile/malleable

###### Compacted Graphite iron (GCI)
1.7 - 3.0 wt % Si
low levels of Mg and/or Ce
Worm-like graphite microstructure in matrix

Material Properties
	Strength similar to ductile and malleable irons
	Ductility between grey and ductile irons
	High thermal conductivity
	Thermal shock resistance
	Lower oxidation at temperature
Uses :
	Diesel engine, engine blocks, exhaust manifolds, flywheels , brake disks

#### Ferrous Alloys
Pros
	Easy to produce
	economical
	wide range of properties
Cons
	relatively high density(7.9g/cm^3)
	low electrical conductivity
	corrode easily
compared to non-ferrous alloys

## Non-Ferrous Alloys

### Copper alloy
soft ductile
	easy to form difficult to machine
Highly corrosive resistant
Good Thermal and electrical conductivity
Usually alloyed for solid-solution strengthening

#### Brass(Cu + Zn)
soft, ductile
Easily cold worked
alpha(FCC) ( Zn < 25 wt%) softer than Beta'(BCC)
Cartridge casings, automotive radiator, musical instruments

#### Bronze(Cu + Sn/Al/Si/Ni)
Stronger than Brass

#### Be-Cu(1-2.5 wt% Be)
Heat treatable by precipitation-hardening
Strong
Good electrical conductivity
Good corrosion resistance
Expensive
Bushes, Bearings, springs, medical instruments

### Aluminium Alloys
Aluminium
	Low density
	Highly electrical and thermal conductivity
	Corrosion resistant
	Ductile ( even at low temperatures ) - Easily formed
	Low melting point - restricts use at High T
Alloying
	Usually Cu, Mg, Si, Mn, Zn
	Solid solution strengthen or precipitation-hardening(e.g. MgZn2 or CuAl2)
Increase Strength, decrease corrosion resistance
Cast or wrought: have their own temper designation
Aircraft structural parts, cans, automotive parts(engine blocks, manifolds)
Specific Strength - strength to specific gravity ratio (larger load based on weight))

### Magnesium Alloys
Magnesium
	Lowest density 1.7g/cm^3 of structural metals
	Soft, low E: 45GPA but brittle - difficult to deform
	Low melting T
	Very flammable
Alloying
	usually Al, Zn, Mn, rare earth
Cast or wrought
aircraft and missile applications
Recently replacing engineering plastics
	stuff, recyclable, cheaper to produce
	power tools, steering wheels, laptops, cell phones

### Titanium Alloys
Titanium
	Low density
	High specific strength
	High melting T : 1668 deg C
	High E: 107 GPa
	Highly reactive at high T
	very expensive to manufacture
Alloying
	usually Al, V (e.g. Ti-6Al-4V - a + b alloy)
Extremely strong, highly ductile, corrosion resistant
Aerospace, biomedical, petrochemical applications

## Refractory metal alloys
Refractory: very high melting T ( >2400 deg C)
Nb, Mo, W, Ta
High interatomic forces:
	extremely strong, high E, hard even at high T
Used as alloying elements
