# 3.1 Imperfections in Solids

## Point Defects
### Vacancies and self-Interstitials
Types of point defects:
	 [[Vacancies]]
		A Vacant [[lattice]] site, one normally occupied but from which an atom is missing.
		All solids contain vacancies, impossible to create such a material that is free of these defects.
		The equilibrium number of vacancies N𝜐 for a given quantity of material (usually per meter cubed) depends on and increases with temperature according to
		 N𝜐 = N exp(− Q𝜐 / kT)
		 In this expression, N is the total number of atomic sites (most commonly per cubic meter), Q𝜐 is the energy required for the formation of a vacancy (J/mol or eV/atom), T is the absolute temperature in kelvins, 1 and k is the gas or Boltzmann’s constant. The value of k is 1.38 × 10−23 J/atom∙K, or 8.62 × 10−5 eV/atom∙K
	 [[Interstitials]] -  also get self-interstitial
		 Basically an atom from the crystal is pushed into an interstitial site - a small void space that under ordinary circumstances is not occupied.
		 Interstitials cause large distortions in the surrounding lattice because the atom is substantially larger than the interstitial position it is in.
		 Formation of this defect is not very likely, it does exist in small concentrations that are significantly lower than for vacancies.
	 [[Substitutional]] -  when a different atom then one of the material fills an interstitial site.
		 Makes the material not 100% pure, impossible to have 100% purity.
		 Often use this method to make alloys to strengthen or give the material certain properties.

##### [[Point Imperfections]]
both distort the crystal lattice, hindering the movement of atoms and raising the internal strain energy of the lattice.

##### Arrhenius relationship
This is an important relationship for chemistry and materials. In chemistry it is called the Arrhenius relationship, describing how the rate of reaction changes with temperature. In materials science, the same mathematical relationship holds and governs processes like diffusion that are dependent on the movement of atoms.

#### [[Metals]] with [[impurities]] 
impurity or foreign atoms are often added to pure metals to intentionally change their properties - the new material is called a metal alloy

The [[Solute]] ( impurity) atoms are added to the solvent(host) atoms, in their crystal lattice to form a solid solution ( as these atoms form from a solution in the solid phase).

the impurity atom can take up an [[Interstitial]] position in the crystal lattice

or it can take up a substitutional position in the crystal lattice,

### Hume Rothery rules
Factors that influence how easily two elements form a substitutional solid solution are:
1. [[Atomic size]], must be relatively similar atomic radii ( <15% difference).
2. [[Crystal structure]] : similar structure to allow appreciable solid solution.
3. [[Electronegativity]]:  not too far apart else they form an intermetallic.
4. [[Valances]] : a solute typically form a solid solution with a solvent that has a lower valency( i.e. solvent dissolves the solute with higher valency more easily).

For an interstitial solid solution the impurity atom must be small enough to fit into the interatomic spaces, so much smaller.
the maximum allowable concentration, or solid solution limit for interstitial solid solutions is therefore low ( <10 wt%)

[[Metal alloy]] - composition
- The composition of a metal allow is usually given in wt%
- this is not the same as at%

### Specification of Composition
Often need to express the composition (or concentration) of an alloy in terms of its constituent elements. Two most common ways are with Weight/Mass percentage and Atom percent. the basis for weight percent(wt%) is the weight of the particular element relative to the total alloy weight.
For an alloy that contains two hypothetical atoms denoted by 1 and 2, the concentration of 1 in wt%, C1 , is defined as

C1 = m1/( m1 + m2)  × 100 

where m1 and m2 represent the weight (or mass) of elements 1 and 2, respectively. The concentration of 2 is computed in an analogous manner.


The basis for atom percent (at%) calculations is the number of moles of an element in relation to the total moles of the elements in the alloy. The number of moles in some specified mass of a hypothetical element 1, n m1 , may be computed as follows:

n m1 = m1′/ A1

Here, m′1 and A1 denote the mass (in grams) and atomic weight, respectively, for element 1.

Concentration in terms of atom percent of element 1 in an alloy containing element 1 and element 2 atoms, C′1 is defined by

C′1 = n m1/ (n m1 + n m2) × 100 


#### Composition Conversions
Composition Conversions Sometimes it is necessary to convert from one composition scheme to another—for example, from weight percent to atom percent.

We next present equations for making these conversions in terms of the two hypothetical elements 1 and 2. Using the convention of the previous section (i.e., weight percents denoted by C1 and C2 , atom precents by C′1 and C′2 , and atomic weights as A1 and A2 ), we express these conversion equations as follows:

C′1 = C1A2/( C1A2 + C2A1) × 100 (4.6a) 
C′2 = C2A1/( C1A2 + C2A1) × 100 (4.6b)



## Line Defects
- Line - row of atoms
	- Dislocation
#### [[Line Imperfections]]
A line imperfection is a dislocation of the crystal lattice
- due to plastic deformation - cooled too quickly
- during solidification
- due to thermal stress
Burger's Vector ;b: measure of lattice distortion.

the line that is defined along the end of the extra half-plane of atoms = Dislocation line

[[Edge dislocation]] - extra half plane of atoms inserted into the crystal structure 
	b perpendicular to the dislocation line.
	The magnitude of this distortion decreases with distance away from the dislocation line; at positions far removed, the crystal lattice is virtually perfect. Sometimes the edge dislocation in are represented by the symbol ⊥, which also indicates the position of the dislocation line. An edge dislocation may also be formed by an extra half- plane of atoms that is included in the bottom portion of the crystal; its designation is a ⊤.
[[Screw dislocation]] - spiral planar ramp resulting from shear deformation
	b parallel to dislocation line.
	The atomic distortion associated with a screw dislocation is also linear and along a dislocation line. The screw dislocation derives its name from the spiral or helical path or ramp that is traced around the dislocation line by the atomic planes of atoms. Sometimes the symbol (Spiral ) is used to designate a screw dislocation.
Mixed dislocation - combination of edge and screw 

## Area Defects
- Area - region of atoms
	- Grain boundary
#### [[Area Imperfections]]
Any Area where atoms are not bonded to their maximum number of nearest neighbours ( coordination number of crystal structure) are in a higher energy state.
**surfaces** : surface energy or tension
**Grain boundaries**: grain boundary energy.

#### [[Grain Boundaries]]
A grain boundary is an interfacial defect found in polycrystalline materials, separating grains with different crystallographic orientations. Within the boundary, which spans only a few atomic distances, there is a mismatch as one grain transitions to another. If the misalignment is small (a few degrees), it's called a small- or low-angle grain boundary. These can be explained using dislocation arrays:

- **Tilt boundaries** occur when edge dislocations align, with the misorientation angle (𝜃) perpendicular to the boundary.
    
- **Twist boundaries** form when the misorientation is parallel to the boundary, represented by screw dislocations.

The Atoms are bonded less regularly along a grain boundary, consequently there is an interfacial or grain boundary energy similar to surface energy. the magnitude of this energy is a function of the degree of misorientation, being larger for high angle boundaries. 
Grain boundaries are more chemically reactive than the grains themselves as a consequence of this boundary energy, impurity ions often preferentially segregate along these boundaries.
The total interfacial energy is lower in large or coarse grained materials than in fine-grained materials there is less boundary area in the former. 
Grains grow at elevated temperatures to reduce the total boundary energy.

In spite of this disordered arrangement of atoms and lack of regular bonding along grain boundaries, a polycrystalline material is still very strong; cohesive forces within and across the boundary are present. Furthermore, the density of a polycrystalline specimen is virtually identical to that of a single crystal of the same material.

#### [[Phase Boundaries]]
Exist in multiphase materials, in which a different phase exists on each side of the boundary; in addition, each of the constituent phases has its own distinctive physical and or chemical characteristics. 

#### [[Twin Boundaries]]
Mirror plane : reflection of atom lattice position across the twin plane.
Mechanical twin: due to shear forces.
Annealing twin: due to heat treatment.

#### Miscellaneous Interfacial defects
Interfacial defects include stacking faults and ferromagnetic domain walls:

- **Stacking faults** occur in FCC metals due to a disruption in the regular stacking sequence (ABCABC...).
    
- **Ferromagnetic domain walls** separate regions with different magnetization directions in ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials.



**Interfacial energy** is associated with these defects and depends on the type of boundary and material, with external surfaces generally having the highest interfacial energy and domain walls the lowest.


## [[Impurities in ceramics]]

### Atomic Point Defects
Defects involving host atoms may exist in ceramic compounds. as with metals both vacancies and interstitials are possible; however, because ceramic materials contain ions of at least 2 kinds, defects for each ion type may occur. 
- Example NaCl ![[Pasted image 20250224100857.png]]
Na and Cl interstitials and vacancies may exist. Highly improbable that there would be appreciable concentrations of anion interstitials. Anion is large, to fit into small interstitial position, substantial strains on the surrounding ions must be introduced.

The expression defect structure is often used to designate the types and concentrations of atomic defects in ceramics. Because the atoms exist as charged ions, when defect structures are considered, conditions of electroneutrality must be maintained.
Electroneutrality is the state that exists when there are equal number of positive and negative charged ions. As a consequence defects in ceramics don't happen alone.
###### Frenkel defect
if there is a cation vacancy, it could also be balanced by a cation interstitial

###### Schottky defect
if there is an anion [[vacancy]] it must be balanced by a cation vacancy

- **Stoichiometry** refers to ionic compounds having the exact ratio of cations to anions as dictated by their chemical formula, such as NaCl with a 1:1 Na⁺ to Cl⁻ ratio. Deviations from this are termed **non-stoichiometry**.
    
- **Defects in Ionic Solids**:
    
    - **Frenkel defect** involves a cation moving to an interstitial site, leaving a vacancy. It maintains the cation-to-anion ratio.
        
    - **Schottky defect** involves paired vacancies of both cations and anions, also preserving stoichiometry.
        
- The equilibrium numbers of these defects (both Frenkel and Schottky) increase with temperature. The respective formulas relate their formation energy to temperature.
    
- **Non-stoichiometry in Ceramics**: Some ceramics like iron oxide (FeO) deviate from stoichiometry due to variable ionic states. For example, Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺ coexist, and defects like Fe²⁺ vacancies maintain electrical neutrality despite an imbalance in Fe and O ions. This often leads to Fe₁₋ₓO, where "x" represents the deviation.

#### Impurities in Ceramics
Impurities in ceramics can form solid solutions, similar to metals, and are of two types:

1. **Substitutional impurities**: These replace host ions of similar electrical properties (e.g., cations replace cations). For instance, in sodium chloride, Ca²⁺ ions replace Na⁺ ions, and O²⁻ ions replace Cl⁻ ions.
    
2. **Interstitial impurities**: These occur when smaller impurity ions fit into the gaps between host ions.
    

To achieve significant solubility, the impurity and host ions must have closely matching ionic sizes and charges. If there's a charge difference, the crystal compensates to maintain electroneutrality, often through the creation of lattice defects (like vacancies or interstitials).



## Defects in [[Polymers]]
In polymers, point defects differ from those in metals and ceramics due to their unique chainlike macromolecules and crystalline state. Defects such as vacancies and interstitial atoms/ions are present in polymer crystalline regions. Chain ends are also considered defects since they differ chemically from regular chain units, often associated with vacancies.

Additional defects arise from polymer chain characteristics, including branches, chain loops, or tie molecules connecting different crystals. Screw dislocations can occur, and impurities may exist as interstitials or short side branches. Surfaces of chain-folded layers and boundaries between crystalline regions are categorized as interfacial defects. These features highlight the complex defect behavior in polymers compared to metals and ceramics.
