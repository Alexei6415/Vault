# 10.2 the TTT and CCT Diagrams

All with reference to the diagram. 
depending how you cool will either have Alpha- ferrite, pearlite or bainite, or a mixture of 2.

Difference between a TTT and a CCT is that the phase transformation is delayed in a CCT so the curves move to the right

# Lecture Transcript: Phase Transformations in Eutectoid Steel

## Introduction

In today’s lecture, we continue exploring phase transformations, focusing on two key diagrams for eutectoid steel (0.76 wt% carbon): the **Isothermal Transformation Diagram** (Time-Temperature-Transformation, or TTT) and the **Continuous Cooling Transformation Diagram** (CCT). Professor Debbie Blaine will guide us through interpreting these diagrams to understand how austenite transforms into various microstructures.

## Isothermal Transformation Diagram (TTT)

The TTT diagram maps phase transformations at constant temperatures, plotting time (logarithmic x-axis) against temperature (linear y-axis). For eutectoid steel, the eutectoid temperature is 727°C, where austenite transforms into other phases.

### Key Features of the TTT Diagram

- **Austenite (A)**: Above 727°C, the microstructure is 100% austenite, a face-centered cubic (FCC) phase.
- **Pearlite Transformation**: Cooling to a specific temperature below 727°C and holding initiates pearlite formation, a lamellar structure of alpha ferrite (body-centered cubic, BCC) and cementite (Fe₃C). The diagram shows:
    - **Start Line**: Pearlite nucleation begins (e.g., around 1 second at 600°C).
    - **50% Line** (dashed): Half the austenite has transformed.
    - **100% Line** (green): Complete transformation to pearlite (e.g., before 10 seconds at 600°C).
    - Higher temperatures yield coarse pearlite (more diffusion time); lower temperatures produce fine pearlite (less diffusion).
- **Bainite Transformation**: Holding below the bainite nose (purple dashed line, ~500°C) forms bainite, a two-phase microstructure with fine cementite needles in a ferritic matrix.
- **Martensite Transformation**: Rapid quenching below the martensite start temperature (yellow line, ~220°C) forms martensite, a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) single-phase supersaturated solid solution. Carbon from austenite is trapped, creating a diffusionless transformation dependent only on temperature. The diagram includes:
    - **Start Line**: Martensite formation begins.
    - **50% Line**: Half-transformed.
    - **90% Line**: Near-complete transformation.

### Example Scenario

Consider three positions:

1. **Position 1**: Heat above 727°C → 100% austenite.
2. **Position 2**: Cool rapidly to ~600°C, hold briefly (before pearlite nucleation, <1 second) → still 100% austenite, as insufficient time allows diffusion for pearlite formation.
3. **Position 3**: Cool further to below the bainite nose (~450°C), hold long enough for complete bainite transformation → 100% bainite. If quenched to room temperature afterward, bainite remains, as only austenite can transform into martensite.

The transformation follows the Avrami equation, modeling nucleation and growth. The TTT diagram’s third dimension (percent transformed) shows transformation progress, with 50% and 100% points marked by the dashed and green lines, respectively.

## Continuous Cooling Transformation Diagram (CCT)
![[Pasted image 20250504165453.png]]

Unlike the TTT diagram’s isothermal holds, the CCT diagram represents continuous cooling, more common in industrial processes. Cooling rates shift transformation curves to the right, delaying nucleation and completion due to decreasing temperature.

### Key Features of the CCT Diagram

- **Austenite Zone**: Above 727°C, 100% austenite.
- **Pearlite Formation**:
    - **Fast Cooling** (red curve): At ~620°C, pearlite begins forming; by ~560°C (after ~10 minutes), it’s 100% fine pearlite due to limited diffusion.
    - **Slower Cooling** (blue curve): At ~680°C (before 100 seconds), pearlite starts; by ~650°C, it’s 100% coarse pearlite, as longer diffusion time allows larger lamellae.
    - Once pearlite forms, further cooling to room temperature doesn’t alter it, as only austenite


This passage explains **continuous-cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams** and their use in predicting the microstructures of steels after continuous cooling heat treatments:

- **Practicality of Continuous Cooling:** Unlike isothermal heat treatments (which involve holding at a constant temperature), most real-world heat treatments for steels involve continuously cooling the material to room temperature.  
    
- **Modification of IT Diagrams:** Isothermal transformation (IT) diagrams are only valid for constant temperatures. To predict microstructures after continuous cooling, the IT diagrams must be modified into **continuous-cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams**.  
    
- **Shifted Transformation Curves:** On a CCT diagram, the start and end curves for transformations are shifted to **longer times** and **lower temperatures** compared to the corresponding IT diagram. This is because the temperature is constantly decreasing during continuous cooling.  
    
- **Cooling Rate and Microstructure:** The **rate of cooling** plays a critical role in determining the final microstructure:
    
    - **Slow cooling rates** result in the formation of **coarse pearlite**.
    - **Moderately rapid cooling rates** lead to **fine pearlite**.  
        
    - For plain carbon eutectoid steel, continuous cooling usually transforms all austenite to pearlite before the bainite transformation can occur.
    - If cooling is faster, such that the cooling curve intersects the pearlite transformation region and then the martensite start temperature (M&lt;sub>start&lt;/sub>), a mixture of **pearlite and martensite** will form.
    
     
    
- **Martensite Transformation on CCT:** The temperatures for the start (M&lt;sub>start&lt;/sub>), 50% (M&lt;sub>50%&lt;/sub>), and 90% (M&lt;sub>90%&lt;/sub>) martensite formation are the same on both IT and CCT diagrams.
- **Critical Quenching Rate:** There's a **critical quenching rate**, which is the minimum cooling rate needed to completely avoid the formation of pearlite and obtain a fully **martensitic structure**. On the CCT diagram, the cooling curve at this critical rate just touches the "nose" of the pearlite transformation curve.  
    
- **Effect of Alloying Elements on CCT:** Adding carbon and other alloying elements to steel shifts the "noses" of the pearlite (and proeutectoid phases) and bainite transformation curves to longer times. This **decreases the critical cooling rate**, making it easier to form martensite. This is a key reason why steels are often alloyed. Alloying elements can also enable the formation of bainite during continuous cooling.  
    
- **Low Carbon Steels:** Steels with less than about 0.25 wt% carbon are typically not heat-treated to form martensite because the required quenching rates are too rapid to be practically achievable.  
    
- **Effective Alloying Elements for Hardenability:** Chromium, nickel, molybdenum, manganese, silicon, and tungsten are particularly effective in improving the **hardenability** of steel (its ability to form martensite). These elements must be dissolved in the austenite at the start of quenching.
- **Summary:** Both IT and CCT diagrams are essentially time-temperature phase diagrams that help predict the microstructure of a steel alloy of a specific composition after different heat treatments (isothermal or continuous cooling).
