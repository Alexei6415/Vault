# 12.3 Creep

Plastic deformation occurs at very high temperatures relative to the melting point of the melting point.

Why power stations only last 40-60 years -> the pipes would grow radially-> this is creep

Creep = slow permanent growing at high temperatures

### What is creep
1. Occurs at high Temperatures (\(> 0.4 T_m\), where \(T_m\) is the absolute melting temperature)
2. Constant load/stress is applied
3. Permanent/plastic deformation
4. Time-dependent/slow process

**Creep curve:**

* **Primary Creep (Transient Creep):** Creep rate continuously decreases.
* **Secondary Creep (Steady-State Creep):** Creep rate is constant (\(Creep\ rate = \dot{\epsilon}_s = \frac{\Delta\epsilon}{\Delta t}\)). Balance between strain hardening and recovery.
* **Tertiary Creep:** Creep rate increases again until creep rupture occurs.

**Creep testing:**
* Constant load tests (engineering focus).
* Constant stress tests (mechanism understanding).
* Uniaxial tension (metals), uniaxial compression (brittle materials).

### Effect of stress, temperature and material
Creep rate is affected by stress and temperature:
$\dot{\epsilon}_s = K_1 \sigma^n$
$\dot{\epsilon}_s = K_2 \sigma^n \exp\left(-\frac{Q_c}{RT}\right)$

Where:
* $\(\dot{\epsilon}_s\)$ is the steady-state creep rate.
* $\(\sigma\)$ is the applied stress.
* \(T\) is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin).
* $\(K_1\), \(K_2\)$, and \(n\) are material constants.
* \($Q_c$\) is the activation energy for creep.
* \(R\) is the gas constant $(\(8.31 \frac{J}{mol \cdot K}\)).$

Value of \(n\) (stress exponent) and \(Q_c\) tells us what type of creep is occurring (e.g., diffusional creep or dislocation creep).

#### Effects of material properties
* Material properties that improve creep resistance:
    * Higher melting temperatures
    * Stiffer materials (larger Young's modulus)
    * Larger grain sizes (smaller grains permit more grain boundary sliding and result in higher creep rates)

* **Diffusional creep:** Diffusion of vacancies through the lattice or along grain boundaries.
* **Dislocation creep:** Climb of dislocations over obstacles such as precipitates/second phases.

#### Circle back to fracture
* Low creep ductility: low strain at rupture.
* High creep ductility: high strain at rupture.
