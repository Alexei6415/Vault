# 12.3 Creep

Plastic deformation occurs at very high temperatures relative to the melting point of the melting point.

Why power stations only last 40-60 years -> the pipes would grow radially-> this is creep

Creep = slow permanent growing at high temperatures

### What is creep
1. occurs at high Temperatures ( 40% of abs melting temperature)
2. Constant load/stress is applied
3. Permanent/plastic deformation
4. Time-dependent/slow process
Creep curve

Primary State: slowing creep state
Secondary state: Creep rate remains constant $Creep rate =  \frac{\Delta\epsilon}{\Delta t}$
Tertiary state: creep rate increases again until creep rupture occurs.


### Effect of stress, temperature and material
creep is effected by the power law

Value of N and Qc tells us what type of creep is occurring(Slip, dislocation or grain boundary)


#### Effects of material properties
- Material properties that improve creep
	- Higher melting temperatures
	- Stiffer materials(larger Young's modulus)
	- Larger grain sizes ( small grains permit more grain boundary sliding and result in higher creep rates)

Diffusional creep: diffusion of cavities through the lattice or along grain boundaries

Dislocation creep: climb of dislocations over obstacles such as precipitates/second phases



#### Creep testing

Applies a force for a couple of months


#### Circle back to fracture
Low creep ductility has low strains at rupture
a high creep ductility has higher strains at rupture
