# 3.2 Microscopy

_**Definition** : Microscopy is the microscopic study of the [[structural]], or study of the [[microstructural]], characteristics of a material using some type of microscope.

Typically on the microscale : 10^-6m ( smaller than the eye can see)

[[Metallography]] is the study of the microstructure of metals and alloys.

### What do we want to see?
- [[grains]]
- [[Grain boundaries]]
	grain size
	mechanical deformation
- grain surface
	phases due to chemical composition or heat treatment
- inclusions, defects
	shape size

## Size of features

## [[Optical microscope]]
metallurgical microscope work with reflected light
wave length visible light ( 400-700nm)
	limits to 2000x
[[Magnification]] = eyepiece magnification x  objective magnification

[[Metallographic]] preparation of sample is very important
1. grinding -> create a level surface
2. polishing -> create a mirrorlike reflective surface
3. Etching -> chemical reagent reacts with different phases to create surfaces with different reflectance, reveals microstructural features
Result:
	the light bounces off the surface at different angles allowing you to see the different grains easily.![[Pasted image 20250316194234.png]]

## Electron Microscope
Similar concept to optical microscope, but uses electron beam
high velocity electron has a smaller wavelength than visible light 
- allows much greater magnification and resolution
uses magnetic lenses rather than optical lenses

HOW IT WORKS
	surface of specimen is scanned with electron beam.
	reflected beam is collected and displayed on cathode ray tube
	surface preparation
		must be conductive
	magnification up to 50 000x
	Also possible to analyse elemental composition using EDS (energy dispersive spectroscopy)

TEM ( transmission electron microscope)
- electron beam passes through specimen
- transmitted beam projected onto fluorescent screen
- preparation very difficult and time consuming
- very thin film so that electrons can pass through and capture necessary information
- 10^6 x magnification possible

## Scanning Probe Microscopy
- tiny probe with very sharp tip scans surface of specimen
- very close (nm) but does not touch specimen surface
- probe deflects due to atomic interactions with probe
- deflection measures with piezo electrics - 3D computer generated image
