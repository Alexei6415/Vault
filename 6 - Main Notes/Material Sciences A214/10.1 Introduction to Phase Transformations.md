# 10.1 Introduction to Phase Transformations
- **Control of Mechanical Properties:** A key reason for the widespread use of metals is that their strength, hardness, and ductility can be managed over a broad range.
    
- **Review of Strengthening Mechanisms:** Chapter 7 covered three ways to strengthen metals: reducing grain size, adding solute atoms (solid-solution strengthening), and cold working (strain hardening).
    
- **Microstructure and Phase Transformations:** This chapter will focus on another approach: controlling the **microstructure** of an alloy. Microstructure development in both single-phase and two-phase alloys typically involves **phase transformations**, which are changes in the number or type of phases present.
    
- **Chapter Content Overview:** The chapter will cover several key aspects:
    
    - **Basic principles of transformations in solid phases.**
        
    - The **rate** at which these transformations occur over time.
        
    - The development of **two-phase microstructures** specifically in **iron–carbon alloys**.
        
    - How modified **phase diagrams** can be used to predict the microstructure resulting from different **heat treatments**.
        
    - A discussion of other **microconstituents** besides pearlite and how they affect the mechanical properties of steel.


What are Phase transformations?
	Reactions that cause the microstructure
	e.g.
		solidification or melting of a pure element
		polymorphic transformation e.g. alpha ferrite -> gamma-austenite of pure fe at 912 deg C
	Diffusion-dependent transformation with a change in the phases present
		Eutectoid reaction e.g. gamma austenite ( fe-0.76wt%c) -> alpha ferrite ( 0.022wt%C) + Fe3C (6.7wt%C) at 727 deg C
	Diffusionless transformation
		martensite formation due to quenching gamma-austenite

### Basic concepts
- **Category 1: Simple Diffusion-Dependent Transformations:**
    
    - These transformations rely on **diffusion** but do not involve changes in the **number** or **composition** of the phases present.
        
    - Examples include:
        
        - **Solidification of a pure metal:** Liquid to solid, same composition.
            
        - **Allotropic transformations:** Change in crystal structure of a pure element, same composition.
            
        - **Recrystallization and grain growth:** Changes in grain size and arrangement, same phase and composition.
            
- **Category 2: Diffusion-Dependent Transformations with Compositional and/or Number Changes:**
    
    - These transformations also depend on **diffusion** but involve alterations in the **compositions** of existing phases and often changes in the **number** of phases present.
        
    - The final microstructure typically consists of **two phases**.
        
    - Example: The **eutectoid reaction** (like austenite transforming into ferrite and cementite in steel) falls into this category and will be discussed further in Section 10.5.
        
- **Category 3: Diffusionless Transformations:**
    
    - These transformations do **not rely on diffusion**.
        
    - They result in the formation of a **metastable phase** (a non-equilibrium phase that can persist indefinitely).
        
    - Example: The **martensitic transformation** that can occur in some steel alloys is diffusionless and will be discussed in Section 10.5.

#### How do these phase transformations occur.
They are usually time-dependent, i.e. do not occur instantaneously. they begin with the formation of small particles (nuclei) of the new phase(nucleation) which then grows to take over the new microstructure (growth) until the transformation is complete

The kinetics (time dependent nature) of the reaction is described by Avrami's equation

- **New Phase Formation:** Phase transformations usually involve the creation of at least one new phase that has different physical or chemical properties or a different crystal structure compared to the original (parent) phase.
    
- **Two-Stage Process:** Most phase transformations don't happen instantly but proceed through two main stages:
    
    - **Nucleation:** This is the initial step where very small particles, called **nuclei**, of the new phase form. These nuclei are typically just a small cluster of atoms arranged in the structure of the new phase and are stable enough to start growing.
        
    - **Growth:** Once stable nuclei have formed, the **growth** stage begins. During this stage, the nuclei increase in size as more atoms from the parent phase attach to them. This process continues until the parent phase is fully or partially consumed, depending on the equilibrium conditions.
        
- **Reaching Completion:** The phase transformation is considered complete when the amount of the new phase reaches the level predicted by the phase diagram for the given temperature and overall composition (the equilibrium fraction).
    
- **Further Discussion:** The passage indicates that the following sections will provide a more detailed explanation of the mechanisms behind nucleation and growth, specifically in the context of transformations occurring in solid materials (solid-state transformations).


#### Kinetic considerations of solid state transformations
- **Time Dependence is Key:** The rate at which phase transformations occur over time (their kinetics) is very important, especially when considering heat treatments for materials.
- **Measuring Transformation Progress:** The extent of a phase transformation is often measured by tracking the fraction of material that has transformed as time progresses, while keeping the temperature constant. 1 This can be done by observing the microstructure or by measuring changes in physical properties.  
   
- **The S-Shaped Curve:** When the fraction of transformed material is plotted against the logarithm of time, a typical **S-shaped curve** is observed (as shown in Figure 10.10). This curve illustrates the two main stages of transformation: nucleation and growth.
- **Avrami Equation:** The fraction of transformation (y) at a given time (t) for many solid-state reactions can be described by the **Avrami equation**:

    ```
    y = 1 − exp(−ktⁿ)
    ```

    where 'k' and 'n' are constants that depend on the specific reaction.
- **Defining Transformation Rate:** The rate of a transformation is conventionally defined as the inverse of the time it takes for half of the transformation to be completed (t₀.₅):    
    ```
    rate = 1 / t₀.₅
    ```

- **Strong Temperature Influence:** Temperature has a significant impact on how quickly a transformation occurs. Figure 10.11 (not shown) illustrates this with examples of copper recrystallization at different temperatures. The relationship between temperature and transformation rate will be explored further in Section 10.5.
