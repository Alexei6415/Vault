# 10.1 Introduction to Phase Transformations
What are Phase transformations?
	Reactions that cause the microstructure
	e.g.
		solidification or melting of a pure element
		polymorphic transformation e.g. alpha ferrite -> gamma-austenite of pure fe at 912 deg C
	Diffusion-dependent transformation with a change in the phases present
		Eutectoid reaction e.g. gamma austenite ( fe-0.76wt%c) -> alpha ferrite ( 0.022wt%C) + Fe3C (6.7wt%C) at 727 deg C
	Diffusionless transformation
		martensite formation due to quenching gamma-austenite

#### How do these phase transformations occur.
They are usually time-dependent, i.e. do not occur instantaneously. they begin with the formation of small particles (nuclei) of the new phase(nucleation) which then grows to take over the new microstructure (growth) until the transformation is complete

The kinetics (time dependent nature) of the reaction is described by Avrami's equation
