# 5.1 Dislocations and Plastic deformation
Chapter 7 introduces two types of material deformation: _elastic_ (temporary) and _plastic_ (permanent). Plastic deformation occurs at the atomic level, requiring the movement of large numbers of atoms and the rupture/reformation of interatomic bonds. In crystalline solids, this often involves the motion of dislocations‚Äîlinear defects in the crystal structure. The chapter explores dislocations' characteristics, their role in plastic deformation, and the process of twinning as another form of plastic deformation in metals.

Key topics include:

- Techniques to strengthen single-phase metals by manipulating dislocations.
    
- Processes like recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth in plastically deformed metals, typically at high temperatures.
    

Chapter 7 begins by addressing a discrepancy: early predictions of perfect crystal strength were much higher than measured values. This was explained in the 1930s by theorizing dislocations, later confirmed in the 1950s with electron microscopes. A theory of dislocations has since been developed to explain many physical and mechanical behaviours in metals and crystalline ceramics.

## Basic concepts


There are two fundamental types of dislocations in crystalline materials: **edge dislocations** and **screw dislocations**. Edge dislocations involve localized distortion along an extra half-plane of atoms, while screw dislocations result from shear distortion, creating a spiral ramp of atomic planes. Most dislocations are a mix of both types, called mixed dislocations.

**Plastic deformation** occurs through the motion of dislocations under applied shear stress, a process known as _slip_. In edge dislocations, shear stress moves the extra half-plane of atoms step-by-step through the crystal lattice. This motion disrupts the lattice structure temporarily but leaves it ordered before and after passage. Screw dislocations move perpendicular to the stress direction, while mixed dislocations move in directions between parallel and perpendicular.

All metals and alloys contain dislocations introduced during solidification, deformation, or cooling. Dislocation density, representing the number or length of dislocations in a material, varies widely‚Äîhigher in heavily deformed metals and lower in ceramics or silicon single crystals. Heat treatment can reduce dislocation density in metals.

##### Dislocation annihilation 
when 2 dislocations on opposite sides meet when under shear strain in plastic deformation, instead of continuing to the edge the atom plans join and the dislocation is no more.

Slip occurs along close packed planes in the close pack direction. this is because the distance between nuclei in close packed setting is larger than in a not close packed setting, so a slip is easier in a close pack structure.


## Characteristics of Dislocations
Dislocations play a significant role in the mechanical properties of metals. Key points include:

- **Strain Fields**: Surround dislocations and affect their mobility and ability to multiply. These fields interact when dislocations are close to each other, leading to forces that either repel or attract them.
    
- **Stored Energy**: During plastic deformation, about 5% of the deformation energy is retained as strain energy associated with dislocations.
    
- **Types of Strain**: Edge dislocations cause compressive, tensile, and shear lattice strains, while screw dislocations cause pure shear strains.
    
- **Interactions**: Dislocations of the same sign repel each other, while opposite-sign dislocations attract and can annihilate, forming a complete plane.
    
- **Strengthening Mechanism**: Dislocation interactions and density (which increases dramatically during deformation) contribute to the strengthening of metals.
    
- **Formation of Dislocations**: New dislocations form from existing ones, as well as at grain boundaries, defects, and surface irregularities during deformation.



## Slip systems
1. **Dislocations and movement**: Dislocations in a crystal structure are like disruptions in the arrangement of atoms. These disruptions don't move easily on every atomic plane or in every direction. Instead, they move more easily on certain specific planes (called slip planes) and in specific directions (called slip directions).
    
2. **Slip systems**: The combination of the preferred plane (slip plane) and direction (slip direction) is called the "slip system." It depends on the type of crystal structure (like FCC, BCC, or HCP). The goal of the slip system is to minimize atomic distortion during movement.
    
3. **Densest packing**: In a given crystal structure, the slip plane is the plane where atoms are packed most closely (highest planar density). Similarly, the slip direction is the most tightly packed direction of atoms (highest linear density).
    
4. **Face-Centred Cubic (FCC)**: In FCC structures, the slip plane family is {111} (densely packed planes), and the slip direction family is ‚å©110‚å™. Together, they form the slip system {111}‚å©110‚å™. FCC has 12 independent slip systems, making these materials highly ductile (capable of extensive deformation).
    
5. **Other structures**: Body-Centred Cubic (BCC) and Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP) have their own slip systems. However:
    
    - BCC metals have 12 or more slip systems, similar to FCC, making them ductile.
        
    - HCP metals have fewer active slip systems, which makes them brittle and less deformable.
        
6. **Burgers vector**: This vector represents the direction and magnitude of dislocation motion. It varies depending on the crystal structure:
    
    - For FCC: b = (a/‚àö2)‚å©110‚å™
        
    - For BCC: b = (a/‚àö2)‚å©111‚å™
        
    - For HCP: b = (a/‚àö3)‚å©1120‚å™
        

In simple terms, the slip system defines how and where atomic dislocations move to accommodate deformation. Metals with more slip systems (like FCC and BCC) are generally more ductile, while those with fewer (like HCP) are brittle.

A slip system is a group of atoms in the close packed structure which can undergo slipping, FCC have 12 slip systems(12 ways in which the slip can occur)

Slip occurs as a response to shear stress,
RESOLVED SHEAR STRESS, $\tau _R$ : shear stress alone an inclined plane due to load F over A



## Slip in single crystals
**1. What is "slip" and how does it happen?**

- Slip is a type of deformation in materials where layers of atoms slide over each other due to stress. This primarily happens along specific planes (slip planes) and directions (slip directions) within the crystal structure.
    
- Slip is influenced by "dislocations" (defects in the crystal), which move in response to stresses.
    

**2. Resolved Shear Stress (ùúèR):**

- Even if the applied stress is directly pulling (tensile) or pushing (compressive), there are shear forces acting on planes that are not perfectly aligned with the stress. These shear forces are called "resolved shear stresses."
    
- Their magnitude depends on how the slip plane and slip direction are oriented relative to the applied force. The formula is: $$\tau_R = \sigma \cdot \cos \phi \cdot \cos \lambda$$
    
    - ùúé: Applied stress
        
    - ùúô: Angle between the slip plane's normal and the stress direction
        
    - Œª: Angle between the slip direction and the stress direction.
        

**3. Critical Resolved Shear Stress (ùúècrss):**

- This is the minimum amount of shear stress needed to start slip in the crystal. Each material has its unique value for this.
    
- The crystal starts deforming plastically (permanently) when the maximum resolved shear stress (ùúèR(max)) equals this critical value.
    

**4. Yield Strength (ùúéy):**

- Yield strength is the stress required to start plastic deformation. Its formula depends on the critical resolved shear stress and the orientation of the slip plane and direction: $$\sigma_y = \frac{\tau_{crss}}{( \cos \phi \cos \lambda )_{\text{max}}}$$
    
- For the easiest case, where the angles are both 45¬∞: $$\sigma_y = 2 \cdot \tau_{crss}$$
    

**5. Behaviour during deformation:**

- In a single crystal, slip occurs on the "most favourably oriented" planes and directions first (those with the largest resolved shear stress).
    
- With more stretching (tensile stress), additional slip systems can activate, causing visible lines (slip lines) on the crystal‚Äôs surface.
    

**6. Special cases for different crystal types:**

- Face-Centred Cubic (FCC) and Body-Centred Cubic (BCC) metals can activate multiple slip systems, allowing more deformation.
    
- Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP) crystals, with fewer slip systems, are less flexible. If the stress isn‚Äôt aligned favorably, the crystal might fracture instead of deforming.
    

In short, slip involves the movement of dislocations under stress. The ease of this movement depends on the material's structure, orientation, and the critical resolved shear stress required to start slip



## Plastic Deformation of polycrystalline materials.
1. **Random Grain Orientation**: Polycrystalline materials consist of many grains, each with random crystallographic orientations. This randomness means the direction of slip (dislocation motion) varies between grains.
    
2. **Dislocation Motion and Favourable Slip Systems**: In each grain, dislocation motion happens along the slip system with the most favourable orientation relative to the applied stress. The photomicrograph example of deformed copper shows visible _slip lines_‚Äîmicroscopic traces formed by dislocations exiting the grain. Most grains exhibit two intersecting sets of slip lines, indicating the operation of multiple slip systems.
    
3. **Mechanical Integrity During Deformation**: Even under plastic deformation, grain boundaries maintain mechanical integrity and remain coherent. This ensures that grains don't separate or open up. However, each grain's shape is restricted by the surrounding grains.
    
4. **Grain Distortion**: As deformation progresses, grains initially equiaxed (equal dimensions in all directions) become elongated in the direction of the applied stress, as shown in the figures.
    
5. **Higher Strength of Polycrystalline Metals**: Polycrystalline metals are stronger than single crystals due to the geometric constraints at grain boundaries. A single grain cannot deform freely‚Äîit is constrained by adjacent grains, even if it‚Äôs favourably oriented for slip. This constraint leads to higher applied stress being required for overall deformation.
    

In essence, plastic deformation in polycrystalline materials is a result of collective grain distortion and dislocation motion, influenced by the random orientations and interactions of neighbouring grains.


- Grain Boundaries hinder the movement of dislocations, retarding or preventing plastic deformation
- Different orientation of slip planes in different grains.
- Resolved shear stress must be greater than the CRSS for slip to occur
- Grain boundaries remain intact, coherent during deformation

## Deformation by twinning
In certain metals, plastic deformation‚Äîhow materials permanently change shape‚Äîhappens through **slip** (the usual atomic movement) or **twinning** (a less common mechanism).

**Twinning** involves shearing atoms across a boundary (the **twin boundary**), creating a mirror-image arrangement on either side. This can only happen along specific planes and directions dictated by the metal‚Äôs crystal structure. For instance, in body-centered cubic (BCC) metals, twinning follows the (112) plane and [111] direction. Unlike slip, twinning results in a reorientation of the crystal structure, which may activate new slip systems for further deformation.

The key distinctions:

1. Slip preserves the crystal structure on both sides of the slip plane, while twinning reorients it.
    
2. Slip involves distinct atomic displacements, but twinning displacements are smaller than the distance between atoms.
    

Twinning is prevalent in metals with **BCC** or **hexagonal close-packed (HCP)** crystal structures under extreme conditions like low temperatures or high-impact stresses. While twinning contributes less to overall deformation, its real importance is in changing the crystal orientation, enabling the material to deform more easily afterward through slip.
