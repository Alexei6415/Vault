And at lower pressures we get paor ste. So the unary phase diagram is a diagram. It's an equilibrium phase diagram because all of these transformations you see here and these phases you are in equilibrium. Meaning that conditions are changed so slowly that it can reach equilibrium where threeergies at a minimum and it's maintained there unless one of these things are changed. Pressure, temperature, composition. Why do you think it's called a unary phase start? What is one here? Perfect composition. Right. We only have water that's one component but we're put to a component. So if you've got an alloy you talk about steel which is the main components are iron and carbon. So fundamentally a iron carbine system looks at two components. So it's a binary phase r. This is unary or it's also known as a pressure temperature based argument. Why? Because we've got pressure on the verical axis and temperature on the arizle. And what are those lines represent? What do you think? Well, let's follow the dotted line. If I'm moving from left to right here on horizontal line at constant pressure that is one atmosphere that atmospher extended atmospheric pressure and I'm heating up from some zero temperatures. I hit this mine at roughly zero degrees Celsius. I've experienced a phase transformation great from solid ice and melting to formatequid if I continue to heat. So increase the temperature and equilibrium conditions. Then at roughly 100 degrees Celsius at one atmosphere I oil I I vorized I call the steam. So whenever I cross these lines that separate these different phase regions I'm moving from one phase into another. These ag transformation. And there's another very interesting point on this diagram. It's represented by. Oh and this is an invariant point meaning it's a point that's set in terms of pressure temperature for a particular system. So in this case pur water it is roughly at about.001 degrees Celsius and 0006 atmosphere. And you can see at that point where there's an intersection of these lines. All three of those phases solids, the liquid and the vapor coexists in equilibrium. So if I play that video again for you, you'll notice that these are solidizedce drifting kind of on the top here. And then you have the water underneath because obviously something's boiling up through it and that something is the vapper. It coexists at that particular ph. It's known as an invariant point. Invariant does not change in that particular system. It'in stone in terms of pressure. Let look at another unary phase diagram. We're talking about electropes which are solid forms of pol polymorph of a material. So what is this unary phase diagram of carbon? Why does he know that? Because graph likeing diamond are all electns of o it different forms of so and it's interesting given that diamond is the hardest substance we know and graphite is complete opposite the is this general misconception probably originating from a small Diamonds are forever. You heard of this? You know the song? I think it's from a moder movie. So drs are not actually forever forever in terms of my lifetime in your lifetime, but they were actually slowly breaking down into graphite. That is because when they are formed at really high pressures about 100 to 200 kilometers in years across it takes about 1, 2, 3 billion years for being carbon combined. That really amazing tetrahedine structure that. But when you bring that to the surface. So volcanic activity brings these diamond up to the surface. Now they're at sort of atmospheric pressure. They're slowly decomposing into graphite. The diamonds are losing their values. Yes, I'm gettingidd to that. You are so spot on. You guys are really good into group today I used this diagrams to fabricate synthetic dy. So what do we call diamonds then in this scenario when they're at sort of atmospheric temperature atospheric pressure they're no longer equilibrium structures. They are in their non equilibrium state known as a beta stable state. Remembera it's kind of there but not really it's stable in the sense of the changes are so slow but it is slowly changing into its allotropic form of graph. Okay, but not within a timeline bit worry about now back in the day element 6 which is a diamond synthetic diamond manufacturer. So I'm so bad ah they used to sponsor beast_ial they more contact but this is not their equipment. But they have similar equipment to this called high temperature high pressure. And they have really really high pressures applied with very high temperatures. Roughly it's not too high, 502600 degrees Celsius along with a metal catalyst and a seed crystal. So a diamond seed crystal. And under these conditions you can grow diamonds really really slowly. And this is what they doetic diamonds with different kinds of properties patients and what this is quite interesting because I p this from element YouTube channel but they see kinds of pressures that they need. As you can see from the phase diagram we the order of between 1 and 10 gigapascals of pressure even Higher with the catalys obviously can bring the temary down a little bit. But that's equivalent to taking the Eiffel Tower which stands un at about 10,000 metric funds and paing that entire ma kind of pressure that you need about 5 16. There are other methods to grow synthetic diamonds, but this one is so. So the time dependency really has a lot to do with theitional. So this is a solid state unary ph diagram. So you should know from your 7 rate very very low. So depending on the refutional rates time to reach. So we ra so equilibrium basaygrams of rap because they kind of give us what to expect but they are really idealized because we do have re transformations and kinetics transformation that come into you learn about next. That's when you can't put something in the furnace. And with our EOM issues unfortunately at the moment, leave it on for 10 years to get that perfect equilibriumructed which in any case is not ideal compared to the nonled. So then what you can do is heat something up to hours September you need when ch water and one a lot of students, two or three students. The years actually come to me and said they make knives k a knives and things like that using these concepts. And none of those properties in the knives are equilibriumestra. They're all non eas in fact metislave multip ss. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Oh, does that answer your question? Diffusion rates are slow, therefore it takes really long for me. And in fact sub structures can't be. They just take too long. So they draw dotted lines on the phase diagrams because the SC. Okay, so now we move on to binary phase diagrams. So this is quite simple extension we work with unary now. So my extension binary phase diagram means that you have two components. Okay. The most simple example that the book has come up with is the sugar water system. So you have two components there you'got sugar and water or H2. And let's calibrate ourselves again. On the vertical axis sees temperature degrees Celsius. And then on the horizontal axis you have something that you should be familiar from you from chapter four last last term, from your tenth edition or chapter six, I think from the ninth edition is composition. So weight percent the composition in weight percent. You'll notice that on the left most edge it's zero weight percent sugar. There's only two components which means that there should be 100% HDO 100% water. Correct. And then you just keep adding these up. They always add up 200%. So right on the right edge you got 100% of PE sugar and zero. It makes sense that weight. So normally when we give you a binary phase diagram, we're not going to give you both components. We'll just express the composition in weight percent of one of those components and you can then deduce that the other component is just 100 wa percent minus whatever you really want. Wrong. Right. That makes sense. They've just done this to explain what they mean with the two component weight. Distributing the weight composition there. Okay, so what do we notice here? Well, on this side here we have a syrup which is an liquid solution that is sugar dissolved in water. So it forms a solution that is one phase. And in here we have two phases. They differ both in physal and chemical. Mic up these two phases. One is physically it liquid, right? Chemically solid sugar is just pure sugar, no water in it. And the liquid has a little bit of water in it. So there'chemical differences and physical differoses. So we have also this nice little line that delineates these two regions and that is known as the solubility limit. It's the maximum amount of one component that can dissolve any other component. So in this case, at any given temperature, you see here 2 degrees Celsius, it's a room temperature. You can see that the equilibrium conditions and by the way is pressure, atmospheric pressure, pressure is constant. Very three things. Pressure, temperature and composition. But in a binary phase, IgO we assume the pressure is constant at one atmosphere. We just put that aside for a moment and we just focus on temperature and composition. So the solubility limit at 20 degrees CelsiusUS, if we follow here, we can see the maximum amount of sugar that will dissolve in water in equilibrium conditions. 1 atmospher roughly what is that? 12, 7, 9, 65. Which sugar? Okay, and maybe if I use an example of this. Who have you done this? Grown your own sugar crystals? It has to be more that you see some do this't recommend. So how does this work? Well, you use this diagram to do it. You start all on the left low side, which is 100% water because zero. When you sugar, you gril that water cool a little bit. So get it to that tem which is just moving on this diagram. Then you add sugar, you add sugar and you keep adding sugar, you keep mixing it in until it dissolves into that syrup and that solution. And what you do then is as soon as you reach that solubility limit, and it's hard to notice that the Sugar is not dissolving anymore, but it's now falling to the bottom of the beaker. You are now crossing that boundary. So you know you're at the solubility limit. But then what happens is when you let it cool and you have a seed crystal, in this case it'ing aick wick which these crystals can crystallize on. Right. The sugar can crystallize on. Then you formate you have a supersaturated solution. It doesn't like that under polyrium conditions. Because you're now here in this two phase region of the phase diagram. So it wants to shoot out that solid sugar. And how does it do it? Well, it crystallize on that seed crystal. That makes sense. Yes, because I'm a bit hazier on this Rolel decinition later. But it has to do with nucation. So the ability to nate the energy required to nucate on something like a weick is much better than the scoot setse of G. So I think the weak axisential heterogeneous muationion. But phase not very up on the science of that. That kind of make sense. Okay, so let's a b your face diagram. But that was all fun because it's tangible. We understand it. Right. It's rele to us. But now we're moving into kind of things that you have to really explore. Understand that phasess can occur different. I can have two pieces of metal here that are the same metals that have different crystal structures or different chemical makeup. And there will be different phases even though they are solids. Different phases in soic form. So when we are referring to binary phase diagrams, all the questions and all the sots ofquentedings we're going to have all going to be around metalic alloys. Soics do have the phase diagrams as well as you would have wrote this from Project 1. But majority of our discussions are going to be limited to metallic alloys. The first phase diagrth that we're going to cover. Don't be too intimidated. Vis it a binary. Binary. It's got two components. What is it? Coppper neickel, which you'll see. I'll explain it just now. So it's a pop and legal system. This is the phase diagram for it. Binary isomorphous phase diagrams. You need to know what these different guard look like and what their definitions are. Eventually the skills we learned to acquire these simple test diagrams will bo up something like this is easy. And you can find the skills that you learn on that simple phase diagr program. And Transcfer something like this, which is a titanium nickel system that also happens to be the components in some of the spartters they use such as NL shape memory. So you will be able to extend those skills to that. But I feel like given the time that I have I think it's basically Move on to an example. I don't have anything left on the site so I'm going to move on to an example. These notes will be provided on Sunb Lear as soon as possible. So you're welcome to just listen because I will provide these notes. Take notes. Okay, so these questions are from the 9th edition but I've pasted them in here. There are similar ones to 10th edition as well but you will have the original 9th edition question. Basically we're going to start with the binaryim morpha system. Before I jump into that question, let me first just show you in detail what that actually looks like it on the. Okay, so let's calibrate ourselves again. Binary two components. One of my components it says it's a coper nickel system. So and the book kind of makes this Obviously we won't always do it but it says here we have 0 weight percent centime. You have pure coppper only 2 so for 08% nickel you have 100 weight percent and on the other extreme 100 percentts notice here on the x axis its composition is weight. But the scientists, material scientists really like to put atomic percent at so when you do get an exam question or a scenario with a phase diagram please just check what is the composition in terms of in terms of atomic percent or in terms of weight. Most of the dealings that we're going to work with you want to work with the weight the same right? We cover on Friday depends on that wa so just make sure it's not always at the top at the bottom top. What you would notice here is that I can do now a little bit these scales are aligned. It looks like the 80 aligns up with the 80 down there 40 over there but it's different compositional. That is not always the case. It happens to be the case with this kind of diagram because of the type of system it is. But the reason why the scales line up meaning composition in terms of atomic percentus percent of nearly the same has to do with it. I've uploaded these notes last week already and I upload them again which just remind you of the existence and it's a very easy 23 mark and the 208 if we go through the conversion between the atomic and the weight compitions. I'm not going to ask this, but you need to understand it at these words. Can you explain it to grammar forance? You go through those derivations, you just look at it briefly. It comes down to copper and nickel lying horizontally, very close to each other on the periodic T level of elements. So they have similar or close together atomic weight. When we get to different systems, for example the Iron 9 carboide system that was mentioned earlier, you'll see those scales are completely misaligned. And that is because iron and carbon differ substantially in terms of the atic. That's why those two all mis andign. They're not really equinaent in other systems, but in isysamorphous case they are. Right, so we have composition two compone copper and nickel. Then here we have temperature and we have various lines Will now why is it called isomorphous? Well, isomorphous comes from isomorph. Think about it. It has something to do with same structure, more structure shape. So you can kind of deduce from that that when you have a binary IM it means that two components are from 0 to 100 WA percent are able to complete solid solubility the solid solutions and at really high temperatures, complete liquid solubility. So in other words, if I put my line above the highest temperature here, I can see that I'm just in a liquid region from 0 to 100. So for all combinations of nickel and copper above a certain temperature, they will just be in liquid form and say called solid. And only a single solid. And it turns out that coppper nickel react this way because of the hume rorie rules, the hu rorie there rules for substitutional SO solution. So if you have two atoms that have similar atomic rad Dy, similar crystal structures, both of these and similar electro ###ies if I give you a tableable and I give you all that information, maybe I'llow a cur and say here denities or here's the the melting temperatures. You would be able to tell whether or not this is going to form an isomorphid systemkay because needs that substitutional or solid solution to form that complete solubility. Think about it. Were't happen an instit. An instititional has very limited spaces and aing latice space. Right. And so you can't have a significant amount of that institutionial sign present between the institutionial sites of the host material. It has to be substitution. Okay, all right. So there's now two lines shown here and it's interesting now because we have a two phase region here in the middle. So back here we've got the liquid. Sometimes it's just represented as l. Then we've got this two phase region with alpha and l. So it's some solid solution which is this alpha. They use Greek letters. When you get to a scenario try to use different Greek letters. Alpha, beta, eater but start with alpha. It's the simplest. That's a solid solution. Yes, it's a solid form and it's got different amounts of nickel and copper ona depending where you are in the system. And then this is a two phase region that separates those regions of solid and the liquid. Then you've got these lines. This is the liquidous line separates the liquid from the two phase region and the solidousl separates the solid region from the two phase region. Okay, so let's get to the questions. It'a very simple question. First the question says we have a copper nickel system and we have a particular alloy that consists of 75 weight percent nickel. Byurance we know that the 75 weight percent nickel 5% of it is copper. Yes. Oh right, the brackets. So I'm going to get to that soon. I so I first want to move through the question. I'm going to answer that because it is actually a nice exam. Questionable. So the first one of the question says we have an iloy 75 8% nickel and it's at 1300°C. You know it's qu coordinate 75 waight percent roughly over there 1,300. It's roughly on me. What can tell me at that point? So at that temperature for this particular alloy, what state are we and what phase do we have? We just have the solid solution alpha. Right. So it's just solid and it just consists of this alpha. Now what happens if I gradually heat it and at what point do I start to form? He it's really simple. Think about it. When you re heating something at a constant composition, you're not adding more nickel in, you're moving in. What kind of line? Line. So heating up until we hit decided this line. The first part of the question at what temperature is the first bit of liquid form? So we're busy melting this effectively. Right. The first bit of liquid pos at the temperature where we hit the sollulose line because we're busy going into that too. Bas so we're going to read that temperature off and you can refer to my notes for accuracy. But it's roughly about 1350 degrees Celsius. Okay, does that make sense? The next part of the question is okay, you're now entering this two phase region where you have the Sol, the solid solution, the alpha and you have the liquid. What is the composition of each of those phases? What do you mean? You just told me the Al way at 75 wa percent N nickel that the composition is on average of the whole any is 75 by percent nickel. But if you have to separate the phases out liquid and the solid phase, the dis diffusion of differences the nickel and in this case the copper as well will distribute themselves differently amongst the water. Sorry, the liquid and solid phape. So that first bit of liquid, what is its composition? Well, first bit of liquid that forms if you go and you draw a horizontal line at that temperature, you hit the liquidus line, you come down. That is the composition. That is a composition about 60, 62 3%. It's the composition of the liquid. OK, there's almost no liquid there. But if they worse that would be. But you physically go into this region in order to start your for subsant central mouary. And that liquid will increase as we increase the temperature until we hit a fully liquid state. Maybe was a the last bit of solid, right. We cross into this region, just the liquid region. Okay, so the second last part of the question is at what temperature is the do we put out this way? Well, that is at that temperature there, which is roughly 1, 3, let's say 80 degrees 13852. And what is the composition of thatospirus solid that's left a tiny morsel solid right before it completely melts. You do the same process. You now extend a horizontal line. So we're going like this horizontal and then we pop one down there and we read off that composition of that last bit of solid is roughly about 83 break the same thing. Okay, now we get to the question of what are these points here? Well, these are pure subs.
## Summary
- The unary phase diagram is a diagram. It's an equilibrium phase diagram because all of these transformations you see here and these phases you are in equilibrium. I used this diagrams to fabricate synthetic dy. diamonds. Diamonds are not forever forever in terms of my lifetime in your lifetime, but they were slowly breaking down into graphite.
- Binary phase diagram means that you have two components. They differ both in physical and chemical. Maximum amount of one component that can dissolve any other component. When you let it cool and you have a seed crystal, these crystals can crystallize on.
- Most of our discussions are going to be limited to metallic alloys. Binary isomorphous phase diagrams. You need to know what these different guard look like and what their definitions are. These notes will be provided on StemLEARN as soon as possible.
- They use Greek letters. Alpha, beta, eater but start with alpha. That's a solid form. And then this is a two phase region that separates those regions of solid and the liquid. Okay, so let's get to the questions.
- At 1300°C, what state are we and what phase do we have? We just have the solid solution alpha. And that liquid will increase as we increase the temperature until we hit a fully liquid state. What is the composition of each of those phases?

Behind theiner that now how do we know that this spaceages and where that needs to melt Zeroia that is really and where it at thisari point for that system it doesn't change. It has a set composition. So that point is called euic point. And euctic reaction happens here. Euctic is just on the mo swing to go from the network two different bason heating. You remember the reaction should be able to wr. But then fact that of reaction happens all along. This is alltches between theubility limits of alpha and the beta bas. Remember in this case the alpha is very rich in and the maximum amount ofver put. You see that this is R and silver. And the solubility limit of the lim amount of co that you re going and that is 100 minus 90. Whereas the isomorphous we could sort out the atoms for the entire alpha be some moreincip o this line molecular line that separates two different region from al whereas the liqugr liquid and the al. Okay, so what happens? Why are we doing all? Well, we want to see basming. How do want to predict whaticructure based on thestructureterial. If you performance of that material, you need to tailor those properties by tailoring microstructure_ng treatment for the composition. So dam need to figure I'WORK on a microstructurening. So start off. Let's imagine this is my bas on that question that I showed you why iloaded on other and thatition is. Imagine we've got completely mo and form of that hour. So we're weigh in the the composition. If I had to go and measure how much symbol is the same as the alloy composition at any. Then as we cool it down and we go into this two phase region. Now we're starting past this coolving down. We re starting to form solidify our this other phase. A new case. Initially there small typs of activ. And as we move down, we move very closern thisically above the Iag very right above it. So the reaction has we it's very close. So we're still in that two phase region alpha liquid. But now this alpha has grown. Some of these are paradest one another. And we can see that the compositional alpha we re our PY line on the so it's X sufa in that alpha and the lngquid follow the timeline. Andus line is the same as techn around that. So Techn is at 71 and that is the composition of the. Now what happens When I cross that line something very interesting happens. We undergo the eutectic reaction when we region is no longer stable and what ends up forming there is charerph form alternating layers of has of that react. So why is this of we got has to do with the type of reaction that happens and that means you've got why And I actuallyip actually incidentally looked at the same two kind oferic structures that we'seen in the we know there are only twoases. The first form is the ofular rotphaains that you see that's the primary the other form of otheracters m little bit but when they zoom in a little bit start to see kind of those layers. So when we talk about and we talking about When I was talking about microbe from I'TALKING about that's one doesn't mean that str Aph Indd that makes this is our diagram and original this already online should you should see the notes. I've had complaints that some people aren't understanding week week PR focus not between the two because obvious O so these are as ``lo so this question says we'and they asking hu questions they're saying and then the second is we to do the same procedure how end our so when we talk about the mass fractions of if I have an alloy and let's say I put it below you o and now it's con some side some if I had to separate of that alloy how much of the total rateight ul kilograms is it? 5 kg the alpha 5 kg of the beta. That is what it's asking the mass fraction is if I had to take that weight separate what would the mass raaction of that particular ph If I say very mass here makesing so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to realize that this is notd so we have to quickly lab it and that's quite easy to do. The first part is recognizing that this is the terminal phases over here with your alpha beta and that's horizontontally separated by this two phase region. So this has to be alphobeto next up. This is separated liquid and beta. So this is liquid alpha. This is alpha. Remember what is it Seate and that is okay, so the next thing we need to acknowledge is here is our composition for alloy and we or be that is the X question to be on the diagram. So we had seven 75 degrees Celsius and at 38% silver so we are roughly right underneath and that is a Common thing that we test out because we want to use the values on that gen techn. Oftenimes we'll say just beneath the insective isotome or any other reaction is toume that the reaction has taken you convert it from the liquid to solution. But you can have thevenions of using the values on that. It's not always the case. If I said we were over here, let's say 500 degrees Celsius then you would have to work with the composition limits at point. But oftentimes we just want to test the concept. So we'll say something like you're just beneath the isce that you make the that you roughly on you can use those values and I so that is our point. And we're going to now do something called the never ar we known as inverse because you are going see that invers. So for a level ar, you have a full which is the point around which your level that is your L composition oftenime C0. In this case it's 30%. Then to determine the mass fraction of alpha and beta, I've got to doaw lines that grow across the entire extremity of this. So between the two solubability of limits from there to there. And now I'm going to label two distes. The book uses different things. Ub, X Y. Please don't try and memorize what symbol they is. Just remember that those represent differences in composition. Okay, so I'm going to use something completely. Please don't try and memorize those formulas. Just go with the process. So let's call it some distance's that 1x. So that distance is the difference between the composition of C0 and the solubility lim of the alpha phase. In this case it's 8 minus 8. Okay, and down here let's call this distance Y which is the distance from there to there. When I say distance I just means differencesition you're not going to take. You can. So if you have the values just ##osition in this case y is 91.2 minus the composition in the same case, everything. Okay, so now to calculate the mass fraction it with something simple. The alpha. So the mass fraction of alpha using a capital subsri whatever you'looking for alpha. And remember we're below the euctic isotn so we more or less kind of know what our market structures looks like. So just remember that this is roughly what it looks like. I showed it. Now you've got the eutectic structure and then you ve got that that's what mass. Okay, so the mass fraction of alpha. Now here's where the inverse level rule comes in. Where'that inverse come from? You'll see why it's intuitive just now. Intuitive, but it is something somethingure. So top half is going to be the distance from my fulcrum to the solubility limit of the other phase that so them run from C0 which is later on the so in this case it is Y and and then the thr is the distance between the extremes of so x plus inverse Never. Now if I had to write this out, I'm only going to do it sort of explain this concept. So to get Y again I said to you they use SW beta subscript E minus over the total each of those values we have read them off the graph. In this case it's 91.2 minus 30. That's working with O total difference is 912 1. And when I calculate that I get the following value. It's roughly above let's say zero. So 74% of this ala if I had a high but way theyph that the out what is the br Then there's two ways to calculate that this is the long way. These don't use the long way, but this is a long way. So later is the distance from the to opposite RA in this case would be X over X plus 1 and you can again work that out and do just for state consistency with C0 minus C Al E over and if I work that out but ant roughly around zero. So you subtract what you have here for you only have two phases in that region. This is the phase you're in here you only have you work out what the we the mass fraction is for alpha so one minus that the beta and we can see. That's a good question. Very good. Nice exam. Than we look at the isomorace diagram and you look at the atomic radio let's say which is Then you would see that the is quite similar and they all the other boes for the hu robere rul they swap each other out. That allows that isomorphic phase diagram. But why is that not happening with this particular phase? Now I don't know in the specifics I don't know what is beta in Alph crystal structure. I don't have that in mind. But I would imagine that these are not as substitutional sol they they d are different bal of different electroity and such that they do form maybe more institial subs solid solution. And that's why you have this limited solubility? Because you can't have an dgram with anial because by the definition of isomorphous is you complete solid solability at any point in time. I can take a whole bunch of copper atomsick here I can only go up to at that temperature 8 great percent sufver in this alpha before it once to convert into something else. Remember the sugar solution? We had a single phase of the syrup and then I reached the solubility limit at that temperature and the san sug same kind ofip. So this is most likely the institutional solid solution with all occup that would be wise for me to take diagram_ir okay, so where was I? Right, so we just worked out the alpha beta. Next part of the question is how much what is the mass fraction of the two different micro constitnts? So if you remember that the image of those ancient Roman co replicas that I showed you there were two very characteristic regions. There was the technic structure with the alternating layers and then there was the primary ala. So if we go back to schematic and by the way you should know how to roughly draw these doesn't have to be veryable. You need to know how to draw some m show you the final result reaction. So here we can see there are very two different ones against primary alpha and the euctic structure. So that's why the question statess determine the mass fractions of primary alpha and the euten. So how do we do thisgr? Well, I'm going to use the fresh one. It's just the same diagram. I have to put in some missing information to this al liquid. This is alikay and then we've got our fulcru at 30 roughly over there XY and composition. Now we need to draw our new high line, our new item. So what changes where before we were at the extremes of solubility deal with the alpha and the betaase. Now we're dealing with mro the primary alpha and the take structure. So in the limit I'll that maximum thing. So that means that our dist is I'm going to use something different now. Let's call this U and that is U this the distance is from 71.9 which is the varian point C0 is that allo in question? And then this is still remains primary al with power. So same calculate what our last question is this start with the primary alpha Temure if I had to show you the this diagram again what I'm saying is If I had to pull out these globules, what mass out of the total mass would that occupy? So let's calculate that again the opposite the opp distance to the other. And you might ask why are we limiting it at 71:9? Any'why because we're dealing with a 2 microhitnts. You take the structure, its average composition is 71.9 because it forms from the liquid. And that liquid, if you follow. If we go down like this and you follow the composition along the liquidus line like the transformation it is at 71.9. So that ute structure born out of that metid. Next do our distances. So for primary alpha we go V to the UIC point over U plus V. And just for clarity, I will write out the numbers. So this is 71.9. This here minus C0, which is 30. And this is 71.9 minus the here when I r that out, I rip that out. I get a value of roughly 66% 60 y alloy mass of it consist of prime. How much is does the structure of the I showed you there are only two micro constituents. So 66 is occupied by the 1 MICN. So a quick check. Well, it's just equal to 1 minus alpha due along calculation will get the last part is a tooata question. We should say what is the composition? No, that's not it. What is the mass fraction of the uten? Now remember I said here Eutectic alpha is the alpha that is inside eutectic structure. So alpha occurs in two different primary alpha form and the eute al and remember everything I've just said also applies to first find UT decompositions as well. In that case you have primary beta, not primary alphh. So just inverse the alpha do everything I've just sn. So nice exam question is using that I think maybe the video if you the final week anything that isisy you can look at maybending that lecture session on doing these seures Or I could make extra not but you must think now already what are the asects that you'dropping with? So keep that in mind for the next couple of weeks. All right. So alph focus run the alpha and eu technic so when I want to work out t alpha how do I do I know about that? We don't have to look at the face diaam we have primary alpha. We want to know what the eutectic alpha is. And the sum of those two should be equal to. So where did I work this up? About 74% was the alpha using total 4 percenta and we know that the primary alpha worked out is 0.6 so what is that just subract one the other that means only 8% of the alpha of the entire nway is alpha that's contained structure and more of it is contained in the primary so it six primary but we could see that when we look at of the out working with make sure look at where we are in closer to the and if we limited there we're still close and we that no we should have we look at alpha beta because we should have more alpha and that was the case in terms have way more primary. I have 14 minutes and I'm going to on explaining that you have we cannot go without memorization to some aspect but cases if to show you how extreme that is When I was bit I this information and I wondered well, we could probably it shows you it is diffic I do have a manoric that I can you so rem ``ankine and you study that section find on yoururs for the ex ofct information. So let's have a look at this diagram. First of all, what is the iron Iron caride based program. It is the foundation for all the dominant iron and carbon alloys things added decoration resistance prarily. Now you might be thinking well, why don't we call iron carbon are looking at ailrium ph diagram Most movies is a so what do I mean with that? Let's calibrate ourselves in terms what about so here first of all we've got composition. That composition is always written in we percent carbon and up here it will be atom and you can see that these scales are not al large roughlyember why and then we've got temperature. That's a very easy one and that is to. Okay, now we've got to a label things. You'll see that this diagram unlike the other one we seen doesn't go to a hundred. That's because we don't high when you work with your signs. But we like to end this space diagram with a very specific number six. That is what itondsmediate known as cement typ or every three how remembered it doing hard and brittle the main blackin ###ists I could perceed only on that line. Everywhere else it you can't see that line because it's obviously on next few with thegram from there to. Okay, so that's CE main type 6.7 and it's also known as iron carbon. That's why we call it iron iron carbo here is iron. Today I'm going to write that there. That's so here ion has various other room temperatures known as something ultimate presenteda iron called the other name Think about and diet. You have this. To answer your question. You have this dip soft, right? And now you're adding that hard cementide one reinforces the other. And you get this combined action combined product. That is just better properties of both. That's why the last one I want to quickly indicate to you outside. So you have that fair here on the end. And you can see it's very tiny sliver. In fact, they exaggerated on this diagram. You can't see so SM. That limit over there is 0022. Very, very small solility limit of carbo. So youron is an alphaite. You can see that by going up here. Then it experience and electropic transma degrees CESIUS 1. You need and it forms gamma gamma ion orite. Austenite is very, very, very important. We're going to use that for the rest unstable below this U to iland what we work with to form other. Okay, then you continue on to roughlyember. And then this is 1-538-Degrees Celsius. You fully melt your iron. We don't deal with the delta ion. It is on the higher end. It's a temature. We don't offer lo at'not really so know about it. But we're not going to ask any calculations. Okay, so the last thing I want to point out to you is. Okay, then we've got liquid here. That's justle. You've got the two phase regions. This separates theide liquid. So that's also liquid. This is cement type from liquid. This isite and cementite. And this is your ferrite and your cementite. That's how fast I want you it out. The last thing I want to point out is quite interesting what you notice very strange here. Look at the austenite. Be my view. Austenite is FCC and ferrite is bcc. Put the together thecc does not go with the ferrite. It b always remember socc andite is fcc. What do you notice here? This region is huge terms expansion on the weight percent carbon. Whereas look at the slither hereul faro. That means that carbon an institutional it finds limited spaces in the oromeite versus ferrite. I'm sorry, very limited spaces in the ferriide. That's why it's sliver. And it finds suitable spaces in the orite increasing that solubility limit to over a hundred times that's 2.14 and the reason for that is quite counterintuitive I said so which one is higher atomic packing a higher atomic paing why are we see this suitable? There might be more space in general, but there are and the walking before those loc I.
## Summary
- Behind theiner that now how do we know that this spaceages and where that needs to melt Zeroia. How do want to predict whaticructure based on thestructureterial. If you performance of that material, you need to tailor those properties by tailoring microstructure treatment for the composition.
- The eutectic reaction when we region is no longer stable and what ends up forming there is charerph form alternating layers of has of that react. Why is this of we got has to do with the type of reaction that happens and that means you've got why.
- To determine the mass fraction of alpha and beta, I've got to doaw lines that grow across the entire extremity of this. Here's where the inverse level rule comes in. You'll see why it's intuitive just now.
- The mass fraction of the uten is equal to 1 minus alpha due along calculation. Everything I've just said also applies to first find UT decompositions. Nice exam question is using that. Keep that in mind for the next couple of weeks.
- Iron caride based program is the foundation for all the dominant iron and carbon alloys. I have 14 minutes and I'm going to on explaining that you have we cannot go without memorization to some aspect. Let's have a look at this diagram.
