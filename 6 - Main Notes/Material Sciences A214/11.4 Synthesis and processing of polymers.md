# 11.4 Synthesis and processing of polymers

### Polymerization

##### Addition Polymerization (Chain Reaction Polymerization)

* Monomers with double bonds join linearly to form large macromolecules (polymers).
* The product molecule's composition is an exact multiple of the monomer.
* **Stages:**
    * **Initiation:** An active center is formed by the reaction of an initiator (or catalyst) with a monomer.
    * **Propagation:** The polymer chain grows rapidly by the sequential addition of monomers to the active growing end.
    * **Termination:** Chain growth ends through:
        * **Combination:** Two active chain ends join to form one larger molecule.
        * **Disproportionation:** Two active chains react to form two stable "dead" chains.
* Molecular weight is controlled by the relative rates of initiation, propagation, and termination.
* **Examples:** Polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(vinyl chloride), polystyrene, and many copolymers.

##### Condensation Polymerization (Step Reaction Polymerization)

* Polymers form through stepwise intermolecular chemical reactions involving one or more different monomers.
* A low-molecular-weight by-product (e.g., water or methyl alcohol) is usually eliminated.
* No single reactant molecule has the same chemical formula as the repeat unit.
* The reaction occurs every time a repeat unit is formed, leading to a linear molecule through repetition.
* Can also produce crosslinked and network polymers using trifunctional or higher functional monomers.
* Generally slower than addition polymerization.
* **Examples:** Thermosetting polyesters, nylons, polycarbonates, and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET).

### Polymer Additives

Foreign substances intentionally added to polymers to enhance or modify their properties.

##### Fillers: Inert Foreign Substances

* Improve tensile and compressive strength, abrasion resistance, toughness, dimensional stability, and thermal stability.
* Particle sizes range from nanometers (>10nm) to macroscopic dimensions.
* Examples include wood flour (finely powdered sawdust), silica flour and sand, glass, clay, talc, limestone, and some synthetic polymers.
* A polymer combined with fillers is classified as a composite material.
* Often cost-effective, replacing some of the more expensive polymer volume.

##### Colorants: Additives that Impart Specific Color to a Polymer

* **Dyes:** Molecules that dissolve in the polymer.
* **Pigments:** Small particle fillers that do not dissolve and remain as a separate phase. They can impart both color and opacity. Pigments typically have a refractive index near that of the parent polymer.

##### Plasticizers: Low Molecular Weight, Low Vapor Pressure Polymer Additives

* Small molecules that occupy positions between large polymer chains, increasing interchain distance.
* This reduces secondary intermolecular bonding forces.
* Lower the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymer.
* Commonly used in intrinsically brittle polymers at room temperature, such as poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and some acetate copolymers.
* Enable applications requiring pliability and ductility, such as thin sheets or films, tubing, raincoats, and curtains.

##### Stabilizers: Counteract Deterioration of Polymers

* Protect against deterioration caused by environmental conditions.
* **UV Stabilizers:** Prevent damage from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which can break covalent bonds along molecular chains and potentially cause crosslinking.
    * **UV Absorbers:** Act as a "sunscreen" by absorbing UV radiation, often applied as a thin surface layer.
    * **Reacting Materials:** React with the polymer bonds broken by UV radiation, preventing further damaging reactions.
* **Oxidation Stabilizers:** Protect against deterioration caused by chemical interaction with oxygen (O₂, ozone O₃). These consume oxygen before it reacts with the polymer or prevent oxidation reactions that would further damage the material.

##### Flame Retardants: Enhance the Flame Resistance of Combustible Polymers

* Most pure polymers are flammable, except those with significant chlorine and/or fluorine content like poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).
* Function by:
    * Interfering with the combustion process in the gas phase.
    * Initiating a different combustion reaction that generates less heat, slowing or stopping the burning.
* Often required in products like textiles and children's toys.


### Polymer Forming

moulding is the most common method for shaping plastic polymers. The choice of forming technique for a specific polymer depends on factors like:

1.  Whether the material is thermoplastic or thermosetting.
2.  The softening temperature (if thermoplastic).
3.  The atmospheric stability of the material.
4.  The geometry and size of the finished product.

Fabrication typically occurs at elevated temperatures and often involves applied pressure.

**Thermoplastic Polymers:**

* Formed above their glass transition temperature (Tg) if amorphous, or above their melting temperature if semicrystalline.
* Applied pressure must be maintained during cooling to retain the moulded shape.
* Offer the economic advantage of being recyclable through remelting and reforming.

**Thermosetting Polymers:**

* Typically formed in two stages:
    * **Prepolymer Stage:** A linear polymer (prepolymer) is created as a low-molecular-weight liquid.
    * **Curing Stage:** The liquid is converted into the final hard and stiff product, usually in a mould with the desired shape. Curing involves heating and/or adding catalysts, often under pressure, leading to the formation of crosslinked or network structures at a molecular level.
* Can be removed from the mould while still hot due to their dimensional stability after curing.
* Difficult to recycle, do not melt, usable at higher temperatures than thermoplastics, and often more chemically inert.

#### moulding Techniques

##### Compression moulding and Transfer moulding

* **Compression moulding:** Mixed polymer and additives are placed between heated male and female mould members. Pressure is applied to make the viscous plastic flow and conform to the mould shape. Raw materials can be pre-mixed and cold-pressed into a **preform**. Preheating the preform can reduce moulding time and pressure, extend die life, and improve the uniformity of the finished piece. Suitable for both thermoplastics and thermosets, but less common and more expensive for thermoplastics compared to extrusion or injection moulding.
* **Transfer moulding:** A variation where solid ingredients are melted in a heated transfer chamber and then injected into the mould chamber. The molten material experiences more uniformly distributed pressure. Primarily used for thermosetting polymers and pieces with complex geometries.

##### Injection moulding

* The most widely used technique for fabricating thermoplastic materials, analogous to die casting for metals.
* Pelletized material is fed into a cylinder and pushed into a heating chamber where it melts.
* A screw or ram then impels the molten plastic through a nozzle into a closed mould cavity under pressure, which is maintained until solidification.
* The mould opens, the piece is ejected, and the cycle repeats.
* **Advantages:** Fast cycle times (typically 10 to 30 seconds for thermoplastics) due to rapid solidification.
* Thermosetting polymers can also be injection moulded; this process, sometimes called **Reaction Injection moulding (RIM)**, involves curing under pressure in a heated mould, leading to longer cycle times than for thermoplastics. Commonly used for materials like polyurethane.

##### Extrusion

* A viscous thermoplastic is forced under pressure through an open-ended die, similar to metal extrusion.
* A mechanical screw or auger propels the pelletized material through a chamber where it is compacted, melted, and formed into a continuous flow of viscous fluid.
* The molten mass is pushed through the die orifice, and the extruded shape solidifies using blowers, water sprays, or a water bath.
* Especially suited for producing continuous lengths with constant cross-sectional geometries, such as rods, tubes, hoses, channels, sheets, and filaments.

##### Blow moulding

* Used for creating hollow plastic containers and is similar to glass blowing.
* A **parison**, which is a length of polymer tubing, is extruded.
* While still semimolten, the parison is placed into a two-piece mould with the desired container shape.
* Air or steam is blown under pressure into the parison, forcing it to conform to the mould's contours.
* Careful control of the parison's temperature and viscosity is essential.

##### Casting

* Similar to metal casting, molten plastic material is poured into a mould and allowed to solidify.
* Can be used for both thermoplastic and thermosetting plastics.
* For thermoplastics, solidification occurs upon cooling.
* For thermosets, hardening results from the polymerization or curing process, often done at elevated temperatures.


### Fabrication of Elastomers

The provided text includes a concept check question about the vulcanization of elastomers but does not explicitly detail the fabrication process. It implies that vulcanization, a process discussed in Section 15.9 (not provided), should occur after the forming operation.

### Fabrication of fibres

The process of forming fibres from bulk polymer material is called **spinning**. The most common method is **melt spinning**:

1.  The polymer is heated until it becomes a viscous liquid.
2.  The molten polymer is pumped through a **spinneret**, a plate containing numerous small, typically round holes.
3.  As the material passes through the orifices, individual fibres are formed.
4.  The fibres are rapidly solidified by cooling with air blowers or a water bath.
5.  The crystallinity of the spun fibre depends on the cooling rate.

The strength of fibres is improved by a post-forming process called **drawing**, which involves the permanent mechanical elongation of the fibre along its axis. Drawing orients the molecular chains in the direction of elongation, enhancing tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and toughness. Melt-spun, drawn fibres typically have a circular cross-section and uniform properties.

Other fibre-forming techniques from polymer solutions include:

* **Dry Spinning:**
    * The polymer is dissolved in a volatile solvent.
    * The solution is pumped through a spinneret into a heated zone, where the solvent evaporates, causing the fibres to solidify.
* **Wet Spinning:**
    * The polymer solution is passed through a spinneret directly into a second solvent that causes the polymer to precipitate out of the solution, forming fibres.

Both dry and wet spinning often result in a skin forming on the fibre surface, followed by shrinkage and an irregular cross-section, leading to increased stiffness (modulus of elasticity).

### Fabrication of Films

Thin polymer films can be produced through various methods:

* **Extrusion:** Extruding molten polymer through a thin die slit, often followed by rolling (calendering) or drawing to reduce thickness and improve strength.
* **Blown Film:**
    * Continuous tubing is extruded through an annular die.
    * Controlled positive gas pressure is maintained inside the tube.
    * The film is drawn axially as it exits the die, causing it to expand like a balloon.
    * This **biaxial drawing** process reduces the wall thickness and produces a thin cylindrical film that can be sealed for bags or cut and laid flat.
    * Blown film exhibits strength in both stretching directions.
* **Coextrusion:** Newer films are made by simultaneously extruding multiple layers of different polymer types.
