# 11.4 Synthesis and processing of polymers

### Polymerization

##### Addition polymerization
- process wherein smaller molecules or monomers are joined to form large macromolecules(polymers)
- Linear joining of monomers with double bonds
- Initiation: active centre formed by initiator/catalyst molecule
- Propagation: linear chain growth through addition of monomers(very fast)

Termination
- Combination: two growing chains join -> one molecule
- disproportionation: two growing chains react -> two molecules("dead chains")
e.g. Polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(vinyl chloride), polystyrene, copolymers

##### Condensation polymerization(step reaction polymerization)
- formation of a polymer macromolecule along with a by product through a step wise intermolecular chemical reactions between one or more different monomers.
-  repeated to produce linear molecule
- can form crosslinked/network polymers
- slower than addition polymerization
e.g. Thermosetting polyesters, nylons, polycarbonates, PET

### Polymer Additives
Foreign substances added to the polymer to change/ improve properties

##### Fillers: inert foreign substances
- Improves strengths, abrasion resistance, toughness, thermal stability
- >10nm and can include sawdust, silica, glass, clay, limestone
- Polymer + filler = composite
- cost effective

##### Colourants: Additives that add specific colour to a polymer
- Dyes: dissolve in polymer
- pigments: small particle fillers that do not dissolve - can give opacity and colour

##### Plasticizers: low molecular weight/low vapor pressure polymer additive that:
- small molecules that increase distance between chains and decrease secondary intermolecular bonds
- lower glass transition temperature
e.g. PVC, acetate copolymers
thin sheets, films, curtains, tubing(require a lot of pliability)


##### Stabilizers: counteracts deterioration of polymers
Protections against UV damage(breaking of bonds) in one of two ways:
- absorbent thin layer of "sunscreen"
- or reacts with polymer bonds destroyed by UV
protect against oxidation deterioration


##### Flame retardants: enhances the flame resistance of combustible polymers by
Disrupting the combustion process in gas phase or
causing combustions reactions at a lower temperature
Often not required in PVC and PTFE
examples: textiles and children's toys


### Polymer Forming
##### Moulding: forming polymers at high temperatures and pressures by shaping within a mould cavity
starting point: fine pellets/granules of plastic.

Thermoplastic polymers
- Amorphous: above Tg
- Semicrystalline: above melting temperature
- Applied pressure needed to maintain moulded shape
- can be recycles: remelted and re-formed

Thermosetting Polymers
- formed in two stages
	- prepolymer: low-molecular-weight liquid
	- curing: heat and/or catalysts harden and stiffen polymer by forming crosslinked/network structures
	- can be removed hot from mould
- Cannot be recycles or melted
- more heat resistance and chemically inert

###### Compression moulding/transfer moulding
Liquid polymer is forced and compressed in a mould where it takes the moulds shape

Used for thermosetting polymers and thermoplastics ( but takes longer and is more expensive)

transfer moulding is used for thermosetting polymers and complex geometries

###### Injection Moulding
Similar to die casting of metals
Thermoplastics: fast cycle times

Thermosetting plastics: curing  in heated and pressurized mould - increase lead times
