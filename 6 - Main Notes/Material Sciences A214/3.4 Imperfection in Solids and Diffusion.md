# 3.4 Imperfection in Solids and Diffusion

Metals with impurities - Alloys
Hume-Rothery Rules
	Factors that influence how easily two elements form a [[Substitutional]] solid solution are:
	1. [[Atomic size]] - must be relatively similar atomic radii
	2. [[Crystal Structure]] - similar structure to allow appreciable solid solution
	3. [[Electronegativity]] - not too far apart else they form an intermetallic
	4. [[Valances]] - A solute typically forms a solid solution with a solvent that has a lower valency ( i.e. solvent dissolves solute with higher valency more easily)


For an interstitial solid solution the impurity atom must be small enough to fit into the interatomic spaces, so much smaller.
The maximum allowable concentration or solid solution limit for interstitial solutions is therefore low ( <10wt%)

#### Steady State Diffusion
- How fast does diffusion occur?
- What is flux,J, or mass transfer rate, kg/m^2.s
  J = M/At - Mass, M - kg transferring through an area, A - m^2 over an amount of time , t - s
- Driving force : concentration gradient.
  J = -D dC/dx - Flux, J, is controlled by the diffusion coefficient, D - m^2 /s and dependent on the change in concentration, dC kg/M^3 over distance, dx - m in the solid

Then is the diffusion co-efficient is independent of composition, then:
