# 10.4 In-person Lecture - Phase Transformations

![[Recording 20250414105527.m4a]]
## Transcript
## Announcements and Course Updates

Please verify that your score out of 120 on STEMOne matches the official record. Several students have reported discrepancies, particularly with moderated scripts. If you notice any issues, inform me by Wednesday, when I’ll make an announcement to double-check scores. If discrepancies persist, notify us promptly.

This week, you’ll see me twice due to the upcoming holiday schedule. We’ll meet Thursday and Friday, with a lecture in the morning. The preparation quiz will open Friday morning and remain available all semester. Ensure you complete the preparatory lesson, which supports the quiz and practical coursework. On Friday, begin the practical preparation course, to be completed between 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. There’s no time limit within that window, and if you’ve reviewed the materials, it should be straightforward—just selecting a few items, no extensive submission required.

### Important Reminders

- **Practicals vs. Projects**: Do not confuse the two. Missing a practical test risks an incomplete grade, so prioritize attendance and completion. If you face scheduling conflicts, email us to discuss options, but make-up opportunities are granted only in exceptional cases, evaluated individually.
- **Projects**: We assess the top three out of four projects. Missing one results in a zero for that project, but it won’t necessarily harm your grade if the others are strong. Most students seem to be skipping the metals project, so expect it to be critical. Even if you skip one, study the material, as projects influence exam content (2–5 marks per project, occasionally more, averaging 20 marks total).
- **Study Strategy**: Never skip learning opportunities. Projects require significant effort, so leverage them to reinforce your understanding, especially since exam weight is substantial for uncompleted projects.

## Technical Discussion: Copper-Silver System and Phase Diagrams

Last week, a student asked why the copper-silver system forms a eutectic rather than an isomorphous system. I initially speculated that Hume-Rothery rules might not apply fully, but after further research, I’d like to clarify.

### Isomorphous vs. Eutectic Systems

An isomorphous system exhibits complete solid and liquid solubility across all compositions (0–100 wt%), forming a single-phase region. The copper-silver system, however, is eutectic, with limited solubility. To understand why, let’s apply the Hume-Rothery rules:

1. **Crystal Structure**: Both copper and silver have face-centered cubic (FCC) structures, suggesting compatibility.
2. **Electronegativity**: Copper (1.9) and silver (1.9) are close, reducing the likelihood of forming intermetallic compounds.
3. **Valency**: Both typically exhibit a +1 valence, aligning well.
4. **Atomic Radius**: The atomic radius difference is within the 15% threshold (approximately 2–2.5%), technically allowing substitutional solid solutions.

Despite meeting these criteria, complete solubility doesn’t occur. Silver atoms strain the copper lattice (and vice versa), but the key factor is **mixing enthalpy**. When copper and silver combine, the process absorbs heat (positive enthalpy), making a homogeneous solid solution thermodynamically unfavorable. Instead, each prefers to cluster with its own kind, forming a eutectic system with partial solubility.

### Lesson Learned

The Hume-Rothery rules are guidelines, not absolutes. Other factors, like mixing enthalpy, influence phase behavior. This complexity underscores that materials science evolves, and even experts refine their understanding over time.

## Iron-Carbide Phase Diagram

This week, we’ll dive deeper into the iron-carbide phase diagram, focusing on phase transformations and non-equilibrium conditions.

### Key Concepts

- **Austenite**: The parent phase, which transforms into other phases based on temperature and composition.
- **Eutectoid Reaction**: At 0.76 wt% carbon and 727°C (1000 K), austenite transforms into pearlite, a lamellar structure of ferrite and cementite. This is an invariant point where significant transformations occur due to carbon diffusion.
- **Hypoeutectoid Alloys** (<0.76 wt% carbon): As austenite cools below the eutectoid temperature, it forms proeutectoid ferrite along grain boundaries, followed by pearlite. For example, at 0.38 wt% carbon, ferrite dominates due to proximity to the ferrite region on the phase diagram.
- **Hypereutectoid Alloys** (>0.76 wt% carbon): Cooling austenite (e.g., 1.21 wt% carbon) forms proeutectoid cementite, then pearlite. Cementite layers are thinner because carbon content is closer to ferrite (0.02 wt%) than cementite (6.7 wt%).

### Microstructure Analysis

Using an optical light microscope, we observe:

- **Hypoeutectoid**: Large ferrite globules and pearlite colonies (alternating ferrite-cementite layers).
- **Hypereutectoid**: Thin cementite layers surrounding pearlite, reflecting carbon-rich cementite’s lower prevalence.

To distinguish hypo- from hypereutectoid:

1. **Composition**: <0.76 wt% (hypo), >0.76 wt% (hyper).
2. **Microstructure**: Ferrite dominates in hypoeutectoid; cementite is prominent but thinner in hypereutectoid.

### Practical Example: Mass Fraction Calculation

Consider 1 kg of austenite with 1.15 wt% carbon, cooled to 725°C (just below the eutectoid isotherm). The microstructure includes pearlite and proeutectoid cementite.

- **Phases**: Ferrite (0.02 wt% carbon) and cementite (6.7 wt% carbon).
- **Lever Rule for Phases**:
    - Cementite mass fraction: 1.15−0.026.7−0.02=0.176.7−0.021.15−0.02​=0.17
    - Mass of cementite: 0.17×1=0.17 kg0.17×1=0.17kg
    - Ferrite mass fraction: 1−0.17=0.831−0.17=0.83
    - Mass of ferrite: 0.83×1=0.83 kg0.83×1=0.83kg
- **Microconstituents**: Pearlite (0.76 wt% carbon) and proeutectoid cementite (6.7 wt% carbon).
    - Proeutectoid cementite mass fraction: 1.15−0.766.7−0.76=0.076.7−0.761.15−0.76​=0.07
    - Mass: 0.07×1=0.07 kg0.07×1=0.07kg
    - Pearlite mass fraction: 1−0.07=0.931−0.07=0.93
    - Mass: 0.93×1=0.93 kg0.93×1=0.93kg
- **Cementite Breakdown**: Total cementite (0.17 kg) includes proeutectoid (0.07 kg) and pearlite’s cementite (0.10 kg).

This aligns with the microstructure, where pearlite dominates due to proximity to the eutectoid composition.

## Next Steps

Friday, we’ll explore non-equilibrium transformations and introduce material selection charts (Ashby diagrams) from your phase studies. Review the practical preparation course and phase diagram basics to stay on track.

### Questions?

If you have questions about projects, practicals, or phase diagrams, let me know. Am I moving too slowly or covering the right level of detail? Let’s adjust as needed to keep everyone engaged.
