# 2.2 Structure of polymers

What is a [[polymer]]
	Greek - poly means many, mer means parts, aka molecular chain of repeating parts

### [[Hydrocarbons]]
Combination of Hydrogen and Carbon
	Unsaturated - Double or triple bond between carbons
	Saturated - only single bonds between carbons
Very strong covalent bonds in each molecule but only hydrogen and VDW exist between molecules so HC have low melting and boiling points. however Bp and Mp rise with molecular weight.

Hydrocarbon compounds with the same composition may have different atomic arrangements - [[Isomers]]

### Polymer Molecules
Polymers are huge [[molecules]] in comparison to hydrocarbons
	made by taking monomer(the hydrocarbon) through chemical reaction breaking the monomer apart and adding onto it continuously and getting the polymer in the end
Polymers are often called macromolecules due to their size. 
Within each molecule the atoms are bound together by their covalent interatomic bonds.


### Polymer Chemistry
- **Polymerization Process**: Ethylene gas (C₂H₄) reacts under specific conditions to form polyethylene (PE), a solid polymer. This process begins with the formation of an active center by a catalyst or initiator, which allows the sequential addition of ethylene monomers, creating a long chain polymer.
    
- **Polymer Molecules**: Polymers consist of extremely large molecules (macromolecules) compared to hydrocarbons. These molecules have a carbon-atom backbone where each carbon typically bonds to two adjacent carbons and may also form side bonds.
    
- **Structural Units**: Polymers are made up of repeating structural entities called repeat units. The term "monomer" refers to the small molecule used to synthesize a polymer, and while related, it differs from "repeat unit."
    
- **Polyethylene Structure**: The polyethylene chain is represented as repeating CH₂ units. The chain can be visualized as a zigzag pattern in three dimensions, with carbon-carbon bond angles of approximately 109°.
    
- **Other Polymers**: Different monomers lead to various polymers, such as:
    
    - **PTFE (Teflon)** from tetrafluoroethylene (CF₂=CF₂)
        
    - **PVC** from vinyl chloride (CH₂=CHCl)
        
    - **Polypropylene (PP)** when one H atom in ethylene is replaced with a CH₃ group.
        
- **Polymer Types**:
    
    - **Homopolymers**: Chains with identical repeat units.
        
    - **Copolymers**: Chains with two or more different repeat units.
        
    - **Bifunctional Monomers**: Form linear chains.
        
    - **Trifunctional Monomers**: Create three-dimensional network structures.
        

In essence, polymers are versatile materials formed by linking monomers into large, structured macromolecules with diverse applications and properties.


### Molecular weight and Polymers
Extremely large [[molecular weights]] are observed in polymers with very long chains. During the polymerization process, not all polymer chains will grow the same length; this causes a range of molecular weights, so an average is specified which is determined through various properties such as viscosity and osmotic pressure.

Many Polymer properties are affected by its length and in turn molecular weight
	polymers with short chains(100g/mol) will be liquid at room temperature
	polymers with medium(1000g/mol) chains are waxy solids and soft resins.
	Solid polymers have molecular weights ranging from 10000g/mol to several million g/mol.

### Molecular Shape
Polymers consist of long chains, single chain bonds are capable of rotating and bending in three dimensions.
Polymers consist of large numbers of molecular chains, each of which may bend, coil and kink in any manner of directions. This leads to extensive intertwining and entanglement with neighbouring chains. 
These entanglements are responsible for a number of polymer characteristics, including its large elastic extensions.

Some mechanical and thermal properties of polymers depend on how easily their chain segments can rotate under stress or heat. This rotational flexibility is influenced by the structure and chemistry of the polymer. For instance:

- Chain segments with double bonds (like C=C) are stiff and can't rotate.
    
- Large or bulky side groups, like the phenyl group in polystyrene, limit rotational movement. This makes polystyrene less flexible than polymers like polyethylene.


### Molecular Structure 
#### [[Common Polymers]]

Because Polymers are made up of long chains we get an average molecular weight as opposed to an exact weight

Total Length is not the same as the distance of end to end of polymer.

##### [[Linear Polymers]]
- repeating units are joined together end to end in a single chain.
- flexible
- have extensive hydrogen and VDW forces between chains.
- examples : HDPE, PVC, PMMA, Nylon(PA)
##### [[Branched polymers]]
- side branched chains are connected to the main chain
- side branches influence packing
- examples : LDPE
##### [[Crosslinked Polymers]]
- adjacent linear chains are joined one to another at various positions by covalent bonds
- many rubbers are cross linked, called vulcanization.

##### [[Network polymers]]
- Three-dimensional networks of covalent bonds -> [[Types of bonds]] 
- examples : epoxies, poly urethanes, and phenol-formaldehyde


### Molecular Configuration
For polymers having more than one side atom or group of atoms bonded to the main chain, the regularity and symmetry of the side group arrangement can significantly influence the properties.
#### Stereoisomerism
Stereoisomerism denotes the situation in which atoms are linked together in the same order (head-to-tail) but differ in their spatial arrangement. For one stereoisomer, all of the R groups are situated on the same side of the chain.
This is called isotactic configuration.
The syndiotactic configuration the R groups alternate sides of the chain.
Random positioning of R chains is the atactic configuration.

#### Geometric [[Isomerism]]
Other important chain configurations, or geometric isomers, are possible within re- peat units having a double bond between chain carbon atoms. Bonded to each of the carbon atoms participating in the double bond is a side group, which may be situated on one side of the chain or its opposite. Consider the isoprene repeat unit having the structure `CH3 CH2 CH2 C C H` in which the CH3 group and the H atom are positioned on the same side of the double bond. This is termed a cis structure, and the resulting polymer, cis-polyisoprene, is natural rubber. 
For the alternative isomer the trans structure, the CH3 and H reside on opposite sides of the double bond. 12 Trans- polyisoprene, sometimes called gutta percha, has properties that are distinctly different from those of natural rubber as a result of this configurational alteration. Conversion of trans to cis, or vice versa, is not possible by a simple chain bond rotation because the chain double bond is extremely rigid.

To summarize the preceding sections: Polymer molecules may be characterized in terms of their size, shape, and structure. Molecular size is specified in terms of molecular weight (or degree of polymerization). Molecular shape relates to the degree of chain twisting, coiling, and bending. Molecular structure depends on the manner in which structural units are joined together. Linear, branched, crosslinked, and network structures are all possible, in addition to several isomeric configurations (isotactic, syndiotactic, atactic, cis, and trans). Note that some of the structural elements are not mutually exclusive, and it may be necessary to specify molecular structure in terms of more than one. For example, a linear polymer may also be isotactic.

### [[Copolymers]]
2 or more different types of monomers bonded together in a chain
	random copolymer - they are bonded together randomly.
	alternating copolymer - it goes ababab of the 2 different monomers
	block copolymer - groups of 2 or more joined in alternating pattern
	graft copolymer - when one monomer joins onto the chain of the other monomer

When calculating the degree of polymerization for a copolymer, In this expression, f j and mj are, respectively, the mole fraction and molecular weight of repeat unit j in the polymer chain.
m = Σfjmj 

### [[Polymer Crystals]]
Polymer crystallinity refers to the ordered arrangement of polymer molecular chains, often characterized by unit cells. Unlike metals or ceramics, polymers are usually semicrystalline, with crystalline regions mixed within amorphous areas. Factors such as chain alignment, molecular structure, and cooling rate influence the degree of crystallinity, which can range from entirely amorphous to nearly 95% crystalline.

Key points include:

- Crystalline polymers are denser and often stronger compared to amorphous ones due to tighter chain packing.
    
- Linear polymers crystallize easily, while branching and crosslinking hinder crystallization.
    
- Stereoregularity (e.g., isotactic vs. atactic) also affects crystallinity, with regular geometries promoting crystallization.
    
- Copolymers' crystallinity depends on the regularity of repeat unit arrangements, with random configurations generally being amorphous.
    
- Crystalline polymers exhibit greater resistance to dissolution, heat, and softening.

[[Crystallites]] : small crystalline regions of chain folded lamellae.
Spherulite : spherical structure of crystallites emanating from a nucleation site at the core with amorphous regions in between crystallites.
- **Crystalline regions**: Composed of thin, regularly shaped platelets (lamellae) about 10–20 nm thick and 10 μm long. In these platelets, molecular chains fold back and forth in a "chain-folded model."
    
- **[[Spherulites]]**: When polymers crystallize from a melt, they form spherulitic structures. These spherical structures consist of lamellae radiating from a central nucleation point, separated by amorphous material. Tie-chain molecules connect the lamellae through amorphous regions.
    
- **Microstructural details**: Spherulites contain multiple lamellar crystals, some amorphous material, and form boundaries when they impinge on each other. They show unique patterns like Maltese crosses under polarized light.
    
- **Polymer examples**: Materials like polyethylene, polypropylene, and nylon exhibit this spherulitic structure upon crystallization.
