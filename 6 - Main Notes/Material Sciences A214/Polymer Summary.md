# [[Polymer]] Summary


Usually an organic compound consisting of chains of repeating units with high molecular weights

organic = hydrocarbons
chains of repeat units = structural entities that make up long chains through repetition
high molecular weights = calculated from a range of chain lengths

Mechanical properties of polymers
- Brittle polymers - break under high stress - not high load
- plastic polymers - has similar stress strain diagram to metals, with elastic and plastic regions
- elastomer - can undergo immense amounts of strain without being permanently deformed

#### Brittle vs Plastic
Brittle can undergo immense stress- has chain cross/ network structure and it doesn't truly deform until bonds break and member breaks
plastic Materials have semi crystalline structure, the amorphous regions elongate but once the stress gets high enough the crystalline regions align, when they are aligned they only have weak VDW forces so the regions slip causing a failure the fibrillar structure is what fails.
Elastomer polymers - very rubber like , can deform heavily and still return to original position, this is due to their amorphous chains , as stress increases the chains become straighter,

Elastomers can be Vulcanized -  the process where the double bond breaks in the chain and the bonds then bond with Sulphur which bonds to another chain, Vulcanization greatly increases the maximum stress of the material and increases the modulus of elasticity, example of vulcanized rubber is Car tires

#### Influence of Temperature and strain rate on thermoplastics
Decreasing temp results in :
- Increased E (Youngs' Modulus)
- Increased TS (Tensile Strength)
- Decreased %EL (Ductility)

Increase in Strain Rate
- Same effects are observed as in decrease with temperature
An increase in strain rate means you increase the rate at which a stress is applied to the member

#### Time Dependent Behavior
if we have a metal and apply a force, the strain response is instantaneous, with a polymer it is not.
Stress relaxation test : 
- strain to epsilon 0 and hold, 
- observe decrease in stress with time.

Relaxation modulus:
Er (t) = Sigma(t)/Epsilon 0

Relaxation is dependent on temperature as well.
- At low temperatures the polymer is rigid and has elastic behavior ( amorphous polystyrene)
- At medium temps it is in the transition region aka the viscoelastic stage, almost rubber like.
- At high temperatures we have the viscous area, very little stress is needed to maintain the strain, no elastic behavior. 

### Polymer Fracture
Thermosets are heavily crosslinked therefore brittle
Ductile and brittle modes possible for thermoplastics, brittle fracture occurs for lower T, higher strain rate, sharp notch, scratches, thick specimens, polymer structures that raise the glass transition temperature Tg

Craze - formation prior to cracking in thermoplastics
- spherulites plastically deform
- microvoids and fibrillar bridges form ( with aligned chains)


### Factors influencing Mechanical Properties of Semi-Crystalline Polymers
Increase in Strength -> restraint in alignment of polymer chains-> e.g. entanglements and intermolecular bonding
Increase in E -> increase in secondary bond strength and chain alignment

Molecular weight ( M)
- Tensile modulus (E) unaffected
- Tensile strength (TS) increases with M:
	- Longer chains -> higher M -> more entanglement
Degree of Crystallinity
- Tensile modulus strength increase, ductility decreases:
	- More secondary binding in crystalline ordered regions.
Pre Deformation by drawing
Heat Treating


#### Drawing
Stretches the polymer prior to use, 
Aligns chains in the stretching direction
###### Results of drawing
- Increases Elastic modulus in the stretching direction.
- Increases the tensile strength in the stretching direction
- decreases ductility ( %EL )
##### Annealing After Drawing
- Decreases Alignment
- reverses drawing affect
- Increases degree of crystallinity for Undrawn Polymers
- Contrasts to effect of cold working metals

### Melting vs Glass Transition Temperature

###### What Factors affect Tm and Tg
- Both increase with increasing chain stiffness
- Chain stiffness increased by bulky side groups
- polar groups or side groups
- chain double bonds or aromatic chain group
Higher Molecular Weight = Higher Tm and Tg
Degree of Branching/Crosslinking:
	Small amount of branching introduces defect and lowers Tm and Tg
	Large amounts of branching or crosslinking increases Tg

### Thermoplastics vs Thermosets
Thermoplastic:
	Little Crosslinking
	Ductile
	Soften with heating
	e.g.
		Polypropylene
		polycarbonate
		polystyrene
Thermosets:
	significant crosslinking(10 to 50% of repeat units)
	Hard and brittle
	do not soften with heating


### Types and uses of Polymers : Plastics
Structural rigidity
Thermoplastics and thermosets
all structures ( linear, branched, crosslinked, network)
Amorphous or semicrystalline
Brittle/Stuff or a mixture of elastic and plastic deformations

### Elastomers
Special Application : Dog toys ( KONGs)
Crosslinked materials
	Natural rubber
	Synthetic rubber and thermoplastic elastomers
		SBR - styrene-butadiene rubber: automobile tire material ( carbon black)
		NBR - Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer : fuel hoses
	Silicon Rubber

### Fibers
Length/diameter > 100
Primary use in textiles and composites (aramid fibers)
	Must have high tensile strength and high modulus of elasticity
	Usually highly crystalline & highly polar
Formed by spinning 
	Extrude polymer through spinneret
		Pt plate with 1000's oh holes
		The fibers are drawn under tension
		Leads to highly aligned chains - fibrillar structure

### Various Applications
Coatings - thin film on surface
	to protect item
	improve appearance
	electrical insulation
Adhesives - produce bind between two adherends\
	usually bonded by:
	1. Secondary Bonds ( VDW )
	2. mechanical bonding (penetration into pores/crevices)

	0.025-0.125mm
	Blown film extrusion
	Flexible, high tensile strength
Foams
	Gas bubbles in plastic
