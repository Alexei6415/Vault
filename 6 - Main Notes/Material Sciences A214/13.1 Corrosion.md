# 13.1 Corrosion

### Why do we care about corrosion
- Costly - having to replace parts costs a lot of money if it occurs often
- Can cause catastrophic failure - this can lead to deaths and accidents as well as also costing a lot to replace a lot more then just the single part that failed.
- Aesthetics - Rust/corrosion does not look very good


### What is Corrosion and Degradation?
* **Corrosion:** The destructive and unintentional attack on a metal; it is electrochemical and ordinarily begins at the surface.
* **Degradation:** A broader term encompassing the deterioration of mechanical properties, other physical properties, or appearance of materials due to environmental interactions. This term is often used for polymers and ceramics.

### Corrosion of Metals
* Normally an electrochemical process involving the transfer of electrons.
* **Oxidation (at the anode):** Metal atoms lose electrons and become positively charged ions:
    
    $M \rightarrow M^{n+} + ne^-$
    
    $Examples:$
    
    $Fe \rightarrow Fe^{2+} + 2e^-$
    
    
    $Al \rightarrow Al^{3+} + 3e^-$
    
* **Reduction (at the cathode):** Another chemical species gains the electrons released during oxidation. Examples in acid solutions:
    
    $2H^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow H_2 \text{(gas)}$
    
    
    $O_2 + 4H^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2H_2O$
    
    $Examples in neutral or basic solutions with dissolved oxygen:$
    
    $O_2 + 2H_2O + 4e^- \rightarrow 4(OH^-)$
    
* An overall electrochemical reaction involves at least one oxidation and one reduction reaction (half-reactions). The total rate of oxidation must equal the total rate of reduction.
* **Galvanic Couple:** Two different metals electrically connected in a liquid electrolyte, where one metal corrodes (anode) and the other is protected (cathode).

### Oxidation Reduction Reactions
Oxidation (anode) - Loss of electron
Reduction (Cathode) - Gain of electron
e.g.
    $Zn \rightarrow Zn^{2+} + 2e^-$   ;;;;;   $Fe^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Fe$

##### Measure of ease:
1. Standard emf series ->
How do we rate the relative inertness/activeness of metals? -> Standard electromotive (emf) series
![[Pasted image 20250504192230.png]]
Elements at the top are more likely to reduce (cathodic/noble)
Elements at the bottom are more likely to oxidise (anodic/active)

2. Galvanic series
more practical because it ranks the relative elements reactivity in **seawater**
more practical because Standard emf series is highly idealized (pure metals in 1M solutions at 25°C).
![[Pasted image 20250504192353.png]]
Elements at top are more inert and won't react (cathodic).
Elements at bottom will act as anode and will corrode.

### Electrode Potentials and Cell Potential
* **Standard Half-Cell:** A pure metal electrode immersed in a 1 M solution of its ions at 25°C (298 K).
* **Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE):** A reference half-cell consisting of an inert platinum electrode in a 1 M solution of \(H^+\) ions, saturated with \(H_2\) gas at 1 atm and 25°C. Its standard electrode potential (\(V_0\)) is defined as 0 V.
* **Standard emf Series (Table 17.1):** Ranks metals by their standard electrode potentials measured against the SHE. Metals at the top are noble (less reactive), and metals at the bottom are active (more susceptible to oxidation).
* **Cell Potential (\(\Delta V_0\)) for a Galvanic Couple of two standard half-cells:**
    
    $\Delta V_0 = V_{0(\text{cathode})} - V_{0(\text{anode})} = V_{0(M_2)} - V_{0(M_1)}$
    
    Where \(M_1\) is the metal being oxidized and \(M_2\) is the metal being reduced. For a spontaneous reaction, \(\Delta V_0\) must be positive. The metal lower in the emf series will be oxidized.
* **Nernst Equation:** Accounts for the effect of ion concentration and temperature on the cell potential:
    
    $\Delta V = (V^0_{M_2} - V^0_{M_1}) - \frac{RT}{n\mathcal{F}} \ln \frac{[M_1^{n+}]}{[M_2^{n+}]}$
    
    At 25°C (298 K):
    
    $\Delta V = (V^0_{M_2} - V^0_{M_1}) - \frac{0.0592}{n} \log \frac{[M_1^{n+}]}{[M_2^{n+}]}$
    
    Where:
    * \(R\) is the gas constant (8.31 J/mol·K).
    * \(T\) is the temperature in Kelvin.
    * \(n\) is the number of electrons transferred.
    * $\mathcal{F}$ is the Faraday constant (96,500 C/mol).
    * $[M_1^{n+}]$ and $[M_2^{n+}]$ are the molar concentrations of the metal ions.


### Corrosion Rate
* Proportional to the reaction current density (\(i\)):
    
    $\text{Rate} \propto i$
    
* Influenced by environmental factors:
    * **Fluid Velocity:** Generally increases corrosion due to erosive effects.
    * **Temperature:** Higher temperatures usually lead to faster corrosion rates.
    * **Concentration of Corrosive Species:** Higher concentration often increases corrosion (but can lead to passivation in some cases).
* **Cold Working:** Increases susceptibility to corrosion compared to annealed state.

### Different types of corrosion and how to prevent them:
##### Uniform attack:
Electrochemical corrosion that occurs equally over entire exposed surface
leave a scale/deposit
Most common (rusting of steel etc.)
Slow and predictable
**PREVENTION**:
    Easily with coatings and maintenance

##### Galvanic corrosion
Two dissimilar metals/alloys that are electrically coupled and exposed to electrolyte
Galvanic series:
**PREVENTION**:
    For galvanic couples, pick metals that are close together in galvanic series
    Anode area as large as possible
    Electrically insulate
    Cathodic protection
        Sacrificial anode: preferential corrosion of more reactive (anodic) metal
        Galvanizing steel (application of zinc coating)
        Impressed current cathodic protection (uses a rectifier to force current to flow to cathodic structure to be protected).

##### Crevice corrosion:
Occurs in narrow crevices where there is a concentration gradient of oxygen or ions.
In tight spots of a few micrometres width (under washers for instance) where there is low oxygen
Stainless steel oxide passive layer
In salt water, high concentrations of corroding species develop (such as \(H^+\) and \(Cl^-\))
**PREVENTION**:
    Redesign joins to be welded.
    Use non-absorbing gasket.
    Clean accumulated deposits.
    Design containment vessels for frequent draining to prevent stagnation.

###### Pitting (type of crevice corrosion)
Highly localized where pits and holes form.
Oxidation occurs within the pit and complementary reduction at the surface.
Starts at surface defect such as indentations or scratches, or inclusions like sulphide inclusions that form acid pits.
Hard to detect
**PREVENTION**:
    Stainless steel susceptible to this but alloying with about 2 wt% Molybdenum can assist.
    Polish surfaces to remove defects.

##### Intergranular corrosion
Corrosion that occurs along the grain boundaries of alloys
Stainless steels, 500-800 deg C (950°F - 1450°F), long periods (sensitization)
Cr-carbides (\(Cr_{23}C_6\)) form on boundaries and consume Cr, leading to chromium-depleted zones.
Welding of stainless steels: weld decay
**PREVENTION**:
    Subject the sensitized material to a high-temperature heat treatment to redissolve carbides.
    Lower C wt% (below 0.03 wt% C).
    Alloy with Ti or Nb to form carbides instead of Cr.

##### Selective leaching
One element or constituent is preferentially removed form solid solution alloys
Alloys with aluminium, iron, chromium and cobalt
Example dezincification of brass (selective leaching of zinc from copper-zinc alloys)

##### Erosion-corrosion:
Chemical attack combined with mechanical abrasion or wear due to fluid motion
Destroys protective surface films
Surface grooves/waves in direction of flow
More erosion for suspended particles or bubbles/faster flow
Common in piping, elbows, bends, turbine blades, valves
**PREVENTION**:
    Remove turbulence through design changes.
    Use erosion-resistant materials.
    Remove particulates and bubbles from the fluid.

##### Stress corrosion
Cracking/corrosion that results from tensile stress + corrosive environment
Brittle failure
Cracks form far below tensile Strength, perpendicular to the stress.
Most alloys are susceptible in specific environments (e.g., stainless steels in chloride ions, brass in ammonia).
Stress can be applied or residual (from welding, heat treatment, or phase transformations).
**PREVENTION**:
    Lower the magnitude of the stress (reduce load, increase cross-sectional area).
    Apply appropriate heat treatment to relieve residual stresses.

### Hydrogen Embrittlement
Atomic hydrogen permeates into metal under stress through diffusion
Brittle failure (often transgranular)
Occurs when atomic hydrogen is generated by corrosion (e.g., during pickling of steels in acid, electroplating, or in hydrogen-containing atmospheres at high temperatures).
Poisons like sulfur and arsenic compounds accelerate it by inhibiting the formation of \(H_2\).
High-strength steels and martensitic steels are particularly susceptible. FCC alloys are more resistant.
**PREVENTION**:
    Reduce the tensile strength of the alloy via heat treatment.
    Remove the source of hydrogen.
    "Bake" the alloy at elevated temperature to drive out dissolved hydrogen.
    Substitute a more embrittlement-resistant alloy.

##### Passivation
Normally active metals and alloys become "passive" -> become inert and lose their chemical reactivity
    Chromium, iron, nickel, titanium, aluminium alloys
    Stainless steel containing > 11 wt% Cr
Protective oxide film that forms in oxidizing atmospheres -> adhered to parent material
Barrier to further corrosion
Self-healing
    Sensitive to environment: can cause passive material to revert to active state.

### Accelerants of Corrosion
**Physical Effects:**
- Smaller exposed anode area relative to the cathode area, faster the corrosion rate of the anode (Galvanic Corrosion).
- Time of exposure.

**Environmental Effects:**
- Fluid velocity (more flow, more corrosion due to erosion-corrosion).
- Temperature (increase rate of reactions).
- Increasing concentration of corrosive species (more acidic environment with \(H^+\)).
- Oxygenated moisture.
- Cold-worked metals (e.g., steel nails).

### Corrosion Environments
* **Atmosphere:** Moisture with dissolved oxygen is the main corrosive agent. Marine atmospheres are highly corrosive due to NaCl. Industrial environments can have acid rain (\(H_2SO_4\)). Common metals for atmospheric use include alloys of Al and Cu, and galvanized steel.
* **Aqueous Solutions:**
    * **Freshwater:** Contains dissolved oxygen and minerals (hardness). Cast iron, steel, Al, Cu, brass, some stainless steels are generally suitable.
    * **Seawater:** Contains ~3.5% salt (mostly NaCl), minerals, and organic matter. More corrosive than freshwater, often causing pitting and crevice corrosion. Ti, brass, some bronzes, Cu-Ni alloys, Ni-Cr-Mo alloys are highly resistant.
* **Soils:** Variable composition (moisture, oxygen, salt content, alkalinity, acidity, bacteria). Cast iron and plain carbon steels (with or without coatings) are used for underground structures.
* **Acids, Bases, and Organic Solvents:** Diverse, require specialized references.

### Corrosion Prevention
* **Material Selection:** Choose corrosion-resistant materials based on the environment and application. Consider cost-effectiveness.
* **Environmental Alteration:** Reduce corrosiveness by lowering temperature or fluid velocity, adjusting concentration of species, or adding inhibitors (chemicals that decrease corrosiveness).
* **Design:** Minimize galvanic couples by selecting similar metals. Avoid unfavorable anode/cathode area ratios. Electrically insulate dissimilar metals. Design to prevent crevice corrosion (welded joints, non-absorbing gaskets, drainage). Avoid turbulence and impingement in fluid flow to reduce erosion-corrosion. Reduce applied stresses to prevent stress corrosion.
* **Coatings:** Apply physical barriers like metallic (e.g., galvanizing), ceramic, or polymeric films. Ensure good adhesion and resistance to the environment and mechanical damage.
* **Cathodic Protection:** Supply electrons to the metal to be protected, making it a cathode and inhibiting oxidation.
    * **Sacrificial Anode:** Connect the protected metal to a more reactive (anodic) metal that corrodes preferentially (e.g., Mg or Zn for steel). Used for buried structures (pipes, tanks) and galvanizing.
    * **Impressed Current:** Use an external DC power source to force current towards the protected structure, making it cathodic. Used for pipelines, underground tanks, and marine equipment.
