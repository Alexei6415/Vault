# 13.1 Corrosion

### Why do we care about corrosion
- Costly - having to replace parts costs a lot of money if it occurs often
- Can cause catastrophic failure - this can lead to deaths and accidents as well as also costing a lot to replace a lot more then just the single part that failed.
- Aesthetics - Rust/corrosion does not look very good 


### What is corrosion
- Destruction of a metal by chemical/electrochemical reaction with the environment
- Usually involves a transfer of electrons from one metal to another through oxidation-reduction reactions
- Common example : Rust ( Fe2O3) of iron in sea water(ships)

### Oxidation reduction reactions
Oxidation(anode) - Loss of electron
Reduction(Cathode) - Gain of electron
e.g.
	Zn -> Zn^(2+) + 2e-       ;;;       Fe2+ + 2e -> Fe

##### Measure of ease: 
1. Standard emf series ->![[Pasted image 20250504191920.png]]

How do we rate the relative inertness/activeness of metals? -> Standard electromotive (emf) series
![[Pasted image 20250504192230.png]]
Elements at the top are more likely to reduce
elements at the bottom are more likely to oxidise

2. Galvanic series
more practical because it ranks the relative elements reactivity in **seawater**
more practical because 1 is highly idealized.

Elements at top are more inert and wont react.
Elements at bottom will act as anode and will corrode.

##### Passivation
Normally active metals and alloys become "passive" -> become inert and lose their chemical reactivity
	Chromium, iron , nickel, titanium, aluminium alloys
	Stainless steel containing > 11 wt% Cr
Protective oxide film that forms in oxidizing atmospheres -> adhered to parent material 
Barrier to further corrosion
Self-healing
	Sensitive to environment: can cause passive material to revert to active state.

### Accelerants of corrosion
Physical Effects
- Smaller exposed area, faster the corrosion rate
- Time of exposure
Environmental effects
- Fluid velocity( more flow, more corrosion)
- Temperature( Increase rate of reactions)
- Increasing concentration of corrosive species (more acidic environment with H+)
- Oxygenated moisture
- cold-worked metals(e.gg. steel nails)

### Different types of corrosion and how to prevent them:
##### Uniform attack:
Electrochemical corrosion that occurs equally over entire exposed surface
leave a scale/deposit
Most common(rusting of steel etc.)
Slow and predictable
**PREVENTION**: 
	Easily with coatings and maintenance

##### Galvanic corrosion
Two dissimilar metals/alloys that are electrically couped and exposed to electrolyte
Galvanic series:![[Pasted image 20250504192353.png]]
**PREVENTION**: 
	For galvanic couples, pick metals that are close together in galvanic series
	Anode area as large as possible
	Electrically insulate
	Cathodic protection
		Sacrificial anode: preferential corrosion of more reactive (anodic) metal
		Galvanizing steel ( application of zinc coating)
		Impressed current cathodic protection(uses a rectifier to force current to flow to cathodic structure to be protected).


##### Crevice corrosion:
Occurs in narrow crevices where there is a concentration gradient of oxygen or ions.
In tight spots of a few micrometres width( under washers for instance) where there is low oxygen
Stainless steel oxide passive layer
In salt water, high concentrations of corroding species develop (such as H+ and Cl-)
**PREVENTION**:
	Redesign joins to be welded.
	use non-absorbing gasket.
	Clean accumulated deposits.
	Design containment vessels for frequent draining to prevent stagnation.

###### Pitting (type of crevice corrosion)
Highly localized where pits and holes form.
Oxidation occurs within the pit and complementary reduction at the surface.
Starts at surface defect such as indentations or scratches.
due to inclusions such as sulphide inclusions that form acid pits
Hard to detect
**PREVENTION**:
	Stainless steel susceptible to this but 2 wt% Mo can assist
	Polish surfaces to remove defects

##### Intergranular corrosion
Corrosion that occurs along the grain boundaries of alloys
Stainless steels, 500-800 deg C, long periods
Cr-carbides(Cr26C6) form on boundaries and consume Cr
Welding of stainless steels: weld decay
**PREVENTION**:
	Reheat the steel to high temperatures to dissolve particles
	Lower C wt%
	Alloy with Ti or Nb to form carbides instead of Cr


##### Selective leaching
one element or constituent is preferentially removed form solid solution alloys
Alloys with aluminium, iron, chromium and cobalt
Example dezincification of brass:

##### Erosion-corrosion:
Chemical attack combined with mechanical wear due to fluid motion
destroys protective surface films
surface grooves/waves in direction of flow
more erosion for suspended particles or bubbles/faster flow
Piping, elbows, bends, turbine blades, valves
**PREVENTION**:
	remove turbulence
	Use wear resistant materials

##### Stress corrosion
Cracking/corrosion that results from tensile stress + corrosive environment
Brittle failure
Cracks form far below tensile Strength

**PREVENTION**:
	Lower load
	Increase cross-sectional area
	residual stress relief heat treatment

### hydrogen Embrittlement
Atomic hydrogen permeates into metal under stress through diffusion
Brittle failure(often transgranular)

PREVENTION:
	reduce tensile strength and increase ductility through heat treatment.
	remove hydrogen supply(such as water vapour) and poisons ( H2S, arsenic)
	bake out dissolved/trapped hydrogen
	Use resistant alloys such as FCC alloys, ferritic, Bainitic, etc.(avoid brittle martensite)
