# 6.3 Microstructure development

When looking at a phase diagram, if you take a specific point, can you determine the Microstructure composition(how much alpha and liquid particles etc.)

if you start at a certain point and move down in temperature, how does the microstructure change.

when looking at point a there is only a liquid solution, so the composition of the phase is the same as the material(35%).
when you cool it down and reach the solidus and liquidus line(point b) then small alpha particles will begin appearing in the microstructure, the composition is calculated using a tie line.

at point c the alpha phase continues to grow

point d has a skewed tie line and is mostly alpha phase.

### Mechanical properties of Isomorphous alloys

When the composition changes the Tensile strength will change as the composition changes, and the same goes with ductility. it will change inversely compared to tensile strength

### Microstructure development in Eutectic alloys
In binary isomorphous alloys, the microstructure development is the same procedure at any composition, because you are going through the same
