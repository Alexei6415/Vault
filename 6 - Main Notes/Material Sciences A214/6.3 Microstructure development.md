# 6.3 Microstructure development

When looking at a phase diagram, if you take a specific point, can you determine the Microstructure composition(how much alpha and liquid particles etc.)

if you start at a certain point and move down in temperature, how does the microstructure change.

when looking at point a there is only a liquid solution, so the composition of the phase is the same as the material(35%).
when you cool it down and reach the solidus and liquidus line(point b) then small alpha particles will begin appearing in the microstructure, the composition is calculated using a tie line.

at point c the alpha phase continues to grow

point d has a skewed tie line and is mostly alpha phase.

### Mechanical properties of Isomorphous alloys

When the composition changes the Tensile strength will change as the composition changes, and the same goes with ductility. it will change inversely compared to tensile strength

### Microstructure development in Eutectic alloys
In binary isomorphous alloys, the microstructure development is the same procedure at any composition, because you are going through the same phase lines. However in eutectic phase diagrams not all compositions have the same phase lines.

Case used in explanation is Lead tin Eutectic diagram.

the alpha and beta phase lines do not go to 100 and 0 but rather 1 and 99 in this case, if we focus on the alpha end( calculation and method same for beta end just phases swapped)

Point A is fully liquid,
point B is a mixed microstructure and can be determined using a tie line
point C is fully in the alpha phase

![[Pasted image 20250405183410.png]]
point d is fully liquid
point e is partially alpha and partially liquid, and is solved using a tie line
point f is fully alpha 
point g is alpha with beta particles because it is beyond the maximum solubility of alpha, to determine the composition of alpha and beta you use a tie line again, you draw a horizontal line at that point and you do the reverse of the one you want, if you wanyt alpha you go to the right and whatever point it hits at the solidus line is the wt% of alpha and you go left for beta and when you hit the alpha solidus line you get the wt% of beta.

Case 3 is when you are at the exact alpha and beta point or the Eutectic point of the phase diagram, and its as simple as just reading the values off the graph to get the alpha and beta wt%.

Case 4 is the final case.
most complicated situation to understand.
to get point j, k and l, is the same as before and you use the tie lines.
but to get point m is more complicated.

Microconstituent. when the alpha phase is surrounded by the liquid originally but because the liquid must under go Eutectic phase transformation the original alpha becomes surrounded by the Eutectic phase composition, and there is now a primary alpha and a Eutectic alpha.

watch video for calculation.



This passage explains the process of **equilibrium cooling** for an isomorphous alloy, using a 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu alloy in the copper–nickel system as an example. Here's a summary of the steps:

- **Initial State (Point a):** At 1300°C, the alloy is entirely in the **liquid (L)** phase, with a uniform composition of 35 wt% Ni and 65 wt% Cu.
    
- **Reaching the Liquidus (Point b, ~1260°C):** As the alloy cools and reaches the liquidus line, the first tiny crystals of the **solid α phase** begin to form. These first solid crystals have a composition richer in nickel (approximately 46 wt% Ni) compared to the liquid (which is still about 35 wt% Ni).
    
- **Cooling in the Two-Phase Region (e.g., Point c, 1240°C):** As the cooling continues within the α + L region, several things happen:
    
    - The **composition of the liquid phase** changes, following the liquidus line towards lower nickel content (e.g., at 1240°C, it's about 29 wt% Ni).
        
    - The **composition of the solid α phase** also changes, following the solidus line towards lower nickel content (but always richer than the liquid; e.g., at 1240°C, it's about 40 wt% Ni).
        
    - The **amount (fraction) of the solid α phase** increases as more of the liquid solidifies.
        
    - Importantly, the **overall composition** of the alloy (35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu) remains constant throughout the cooling process, even though the nickel and copper atoms are being redistributed between the liquid and solid phases.
        
- **Just Above the Solidus (Point d, ~1220°C):** Almost all the alloy has solidified. The composition of the solid α phase is now very close to the overall alloy composition (approximately 35 wt% Ni), while the last remaining liquid is poorer in nickel (around 24 wt% Ni).
    
- **Below the Solidus (Point e):** Once the alloy crosses the solidus line, the last bit of liquid solidifies. The final microstructure is a **polycrystalline solid** consisting entirely of the **α phase**, with a uniform composition of 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu.
    
- **Further Cooling:** Once the alloy is completely solid α phase, further cooling to lower temperatures will not cause any more changes in the microstructure or the composition of the α phase, assuming equilibrium is maintained.



### Non-Equilibrium conditions
there will be primary compositions, are not required to be able to read but must understand how they are different from normal phase diagrams.


This passage explains what happens during **non-equilibrium solidification** of isomorphous alloys, contrasting it with the slow, equilibrium cooling described earlier. Here's a summary:

- **Rapid Cooling Prevents Equilibrium:** In most real-world solidification processes, cooling occurs much faster than the extremely slow rates needed for the compositions of the solid and liquid phases to constantly adjust according to the phase diagram (liquidus and solidus lines). This adjustment relies on **diffusion**, which takes time, especially in solid phases and at lower temperatures.
    
- **Assumption of Liquid Equilibrium:** To simplify, this explanation assumes that diffusion in the liquid phase is fast enough to maintain equilibrium in the liquid.
    
- **Initial Solidification Similar:** When a 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu alloy is rapidly cooled, the first solid α phase that forms at the liquidus temperature (point b') has a higher nickel content (46 wt% Ni) than the liquid (35 wt% Ni), similar to equilibrium cooling.
    
- **Compositional Gradients in Solid:** However, as cooling continues (e.g., to point c'), the liquid composition changes, and the α phase that _newly_ solidifies also has a changing composition (e.g., 40 wt% Ni). But, because diffusion in the solid α phase is slow, the α that formed earlier (with 46 wt% Ni) doesn't have time to lose nickel and equalize its composition. This leads to **compositional gradients** within the solid grains – the center is richer in the high-melting element (Ni), and the edges are richer in the low-melting element (Cu).
    
- **Average Solid Composition and Shifted Solidus:** At any given temperature in the two-phase region, the average composition of the solid α phase will be somewhere between the initial and the currently solidifying compositions. This results in an effective **solidus line** that is shifted to higher nickel contents (dashed line in Figure 9.5). The liquidus line remains relatively unchanged due to the assumed rapid diffusion in the liquid.
    
- **Lower Solidification Temperature:** Non-equilibrium solidification is completed at a lower temperature (point e') than what would be expected under equilibrium conditions.
    
- **Segregation and Coring:** The uneven distribution of elements within the solid grains is called **segregation**. This creates a **cored structure**, where the composition varies from the center to the edge of each grain.
    
- **Problems with Coring:** Cored structures can lead to less desirable mechanical properties. When such a casting is reheated, the grain boundary regions (richer in the lower-melting component) can melt prematurely, even below the equilibrium solidus temperature, leading to a loss of strength.
    
- **Homogenization Heat Treatment:** To reduce or eliminate coring, a **homogenization heat treatment** can be performed. This involves heating the alloy to a temperature below the solidus for a period of time, allowing diffusion to occur and create grains with a more uniform composition.
