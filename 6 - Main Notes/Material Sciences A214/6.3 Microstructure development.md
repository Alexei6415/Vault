# 6.3 Microstructure development

When looking at a phase diagram, if you take a specific point, can you determine the Microstructure composition(how much alpha and liquid particles etc.)

if you start at a certain point and move down in temperature, how does the microstructure change.

when looking at point a there is only a liquid solution, so the composition of the phase is the same as the material(35%).
when you cool it down and reach the solidus and liquidus line(point b) then small alpha particles will begin appearing in the microstructure, the composition is calculated using a tie line.

at point c the alpha phase continues to grow

point d has a skewed tie line and is mostly alpha phase.

### Mechanical properties of Isomorphous alloys

When the composition changes the Tensile strength will change as the composition changes, and the same goes with ductility. it will change inversely compared to tensile strength

### Microstructure development in Eutectic alloys
In binary isomorphous alloys, the microstructure development is the same procedure at any composition, because you are going through the same phase lines. However in eutectic phase diagrams not all compositions have the same phase lines.

Case used in explanation is Lead tin Eutectic diagram.

the alpha and beta phase lines do not go to 100 and 0 but rather 1 and 99 in this case, if we focus on the alpha end( calculation and method same for beta end just phases swapped)

Point A is fully liquid,
point B is a mixed microstructure and can be determined using a tie line
point C is fully in the alpha phase

point d is fully liquid
point e is partially alpha and partially liquid, and is solved using a tie line
point f is fully alpha 
point g is alpha with beta particles because it is beyond the maximum solubility of alpha, to determine the composition of alpha and beta you use a tie line again, you draw a horizontal line at that point and you do the reverse of the one you want, if you wanyt alpha you go to the right and whatever point it hits at the solidus line is the wt% of alpha and you go left for beta and when you hit the alpha solidus line you get the wt% of beta.

Case 3 is when you are at the exact alpha and beta point or the Eutectic point of the phase diagram, and its as simple as just reading the values off the graph to get the alpha and beta wt%.

Case 4 is the final case.
most complicated situation to understand.
to get point j, k and l, is the same as before and you use the tie lines.
but to get point m is more complicated.

Microconstituent. when the alpha phase is surrounded by the liquid originally but because the liquid must under go Eutectic phase transformation the original alpha becomes surrounded by the Eutectic phase composition, and there is now a primary alpha and a Eutectic alpha.

watch video for calculation.



### Non-Equilibrium conditions
there will be primary compositions, are not required to be able to read but must understand how they are different from normal phase diagrams.
