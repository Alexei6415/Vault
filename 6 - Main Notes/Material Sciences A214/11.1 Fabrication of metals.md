# 11.1 Fabrication of metals

### Why you must  be concerned during fabrication techniques
if something isn't fabricated properly, e.g. a weld isn't done properly or there are big imperfections in a forged metal then it can cause catastrophic failures which can lead to a calamity and possibly death.

### Metal fabrication techniques
"techniques used to form metals or manufacture components for incorporation into useful products"
	can involve several steps
	Selection depends on:
	- Metal properties
	- Size and shape of end product
	- cost

#### Forming operations
Main features
- Shape a metal through pastic deformation 
- induced by external stress >> yield strength
- most moderately to very ductile metals
- Hot and cold working
	- hot working is at forming temp > recrystallisation temperature
		- Advantages
			- Large deformations possible
			- lower deformation energy requirements
			- no residual stresses
		- Disadvantages
			- Surface oxidation
			- poor surface finish
			- high temperature energy input
	- cold working is at forming temperature < recrystallisation temperature
		- Advantages
			- Good surface finish
			- improves many properties(TS, creep)
		- Disadvantages
			- residual stresses/lowered corrosion resistance
			- distorted grains(anisotropy)
			- High stress input energy needed
			- series of steps coupled with process annealing is EXPENSIVE

##### forging
deforming hot metal through repeated blows/squeeze action
closed die: two halves having finished shape surround the material
open die: simple shapes that do not surround the material ( larger parts)
ADVANTAGES: good grain structures and mechanical properties

##### Rolling
Metal is thinned due to compressive stresses from rollers
cold rolling : sheet, strip, foils
Grooved rolling: I-beams and railroad rails

##### Extrusion
Pushing: bar of metal compressively forced through a hole in a die
Rods and tubing with complicated cross sections 
seamless tubing
##### Drawing
Pulling: pulling a metal piece through a tapered bore through tensile force
thinner cross section through multiple steps/die
Rods, tubing and wires

### Casting
Molten metal poured into cavity
shrinkage after solidification
used for 
	large structures
	lower ductility metals
	lower costs
- Most often used at the end of a fabrication cycle to give the metal its final shape.
- Casting also used if cold or hot working wont be suitable as the material is so low in ductility.
- Casting is additionally used if the finished shape is so complicated that any other method would be impractical.


##### sand casting
uses sand to make mould in 2 halves
sand packed around a pattern
gating systems transport molten metal
can have casting defects such as porous areas where poor solidification occurred 
mould destroyed after use 
rough surface finishes
e.g. Automotive cylinder blocks, dire hydrants and large pipe fittings

##### Die casting
liquid metal forced into die at pressure
uses a permanent two piece steel mould/die
once cooled, part is ejected from die
rapid casting rates - reusable moulds/dies
better control over final surface finish
only small pieces of metal with low melting T(Zinc, aluminium and magnesium)

##### Investment Casting(Lost wax casting)
lost wax casting: uses a pattern made from wax or plastic with low melting T
pattern is coated in slurry and ceramic powders to create mould
mould is heated and pattern is lost/burnt out
excellent surface finish
high dimensional accuracy/fine details
jewellery and dental crowns
Turbine and impeller blades


##### Lost foam casting
Combination of sand and investment casting
Expendable polystyrene foam pattern
sand packed around pattern to form mould
mould filled with molten metal: pattern vaporizes
complex geometries with tight tolerances
Simpler, quicker, cheaper, environmentally friendlier
Engine blocks, crankshafts, marine engine blocks:
	Cast irons and aluminium alloys perfect for this type of casting.

##### Continuous casting
AKA strand casting ( combination of casting and rolling)
Molten metals cast into ingots and hot rolled
creates flat sheet and slabs for secondary forming operations

### Miscellaneous : powder metallurgy
1. Creation of powdered metal
2. compaction of powdered metal into shape
3. heat treatment to densify "green" part
Advantages:
	Low ductility metals used
	High melting temperatures used.
	close tolerances
	porosity (self lubricated bearings)
Disadvantages:
	Porosity can serve as a stress raisers for fracture
	Heat treatment and powder atomization is expensive

#### Welding
Metallurgical joining of two or more metals to create a single piece
Examples: arc and gas welding, brazing and soldering
Local regions of work pieces and filler material ( welding rods/ wire) is heated until melted
Molten filler material fills the fusion joint
High temperatures: heat-affected zone(HAZ)

changes to haz:
	heterogeneous microstructure
	cold worked regions experience recrystallisation: reduced strength, hardness and toughness
	Temperature gradient induces residual stresses: cracking and corrosion
	causes austenization in steels: martensite upon colling(brittle)
	Sensitize stainless steels: intergranular corrosion and weld decay
preheat the parts and cool gradually
use more localized heat input: laser beam welding
Used for high precision ( electronic/automotive industries)
