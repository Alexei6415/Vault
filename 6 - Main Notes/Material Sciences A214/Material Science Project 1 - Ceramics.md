Scenario
"You have just landed an internship at the Stellenbosch Formula racing team, you have been placed on the race development team and you goal is to think of ideas which will help the team win next seasons championship. As a 2nd year engineer studying material science you think the best way to improve the car is with the use of ceramics."

Q1) a) Develop an argument of no more then 300 words for the owner of the Formula Team which outlines all the benefits of using ceramics in the cars design, provide evidence of the benefits by use of examples. (5)

b) Considering the table and graphs provided and your understanding of material science, evaluate the different materials for use in a brake disk for a high performance formula vehicle, make reference to all the data points in the table and state why each material, if not chosen, is not a good fit. (4)

c) Considering the Graphs, analyze how different compositions affect a ceramic material's properties and its characteristics. based on your analysis, which specific composition would you choose for use as a brake disk material in high-performance applications? Justify your choice with relevant reasoning and data from the graph. (4)

Formula 1 cars, the highest level of performance in Formula racing, use Silicon Carbide brakes. These Brakes average at a temperature of 500 degrees C but can reach temperatures of 1500 degrees.  

d) Silicon Carbide (SiC) brakes have an optimal working temperature of around 500 degrees Celsius. Explain why these brakes are effective in high-performance Formula cars, considering factors such as thermal performance, braking force, and wear resistance. Additionally, discuss why these brakes would not be suitable for everyday road cars, taking into account typical driving conditions and performance requirements. (4)

e) Based on your knowledge of ceramics, will ceramic alternatives be beneficial in the bearings of the engine and crankshaft which undergo immense amounts of heat and stress or are standard solid metals like steel, lead and bronze more effective? and why? (3)

TOTAL = 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 20
