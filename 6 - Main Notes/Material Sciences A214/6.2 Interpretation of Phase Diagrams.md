# 6.2 Interpretation of Phase Diagrams

### Binary Isomorphous Systems
First and easiest thing to identify is number and types of phase present.
In Cu and Ni example: 
![[Pasted image 20250317100547.png]]

We have 2 phases :  Alpha and Liquid
We have 3 phase regions : Alpha region, Liquid region, Alpha and liquid region.


2nd thing to identify is the composition of the alloy (might not be the same as the phases.)

If in single phase region, the composition of the phase is the same as the entire alloy.

When not in single phase region, the composition of entire Alloy (Co) = where you are measuring from.

to get composition of the phases you draw a tie line.

Must hit both liquidus and Solidus line
Draw a line down to x axis and it gives the composition of the liquidus phase.
do the same for solidus phase.

Cl = 31,5 wt% Ni
Ca = 42.5 wt% Ni


Last parameter is Phase Amounts ( not the same as number of phases)
	refers to Mass fraction/Phase Fraction of alloy.

Solve by using Tie line again
Level Rule
	Wl = S(distance between opposite phase and its line from point) / (R + S)
	WL = S/ (R+S)
	Wa = R/R+S)
Wa + Wl = 1.


How to get the distance.
	take the composition and use those as lengths
	Wl = S/(R+S)-->
	Wl = (Ca - Co)/(Ca-Cl)
	Wa = R/(R+S) -->
	Wa = (Co - Cl)/(Ca-Cl)


Increase in temp means increase in Wl and decrease temp means increase in Wa.

Rather use Volume fraction ( is exact same basically) just useful cause we can estimate.


This passage explains how to interpret a binary phase diagram to obtain key information about a two-component system at equilibrium for a given temperature and overall composition. Three main types of information can be extracted:

- **Phases Present:** To determine which phases are present, you locate the point corresponding to the alloy's temperature and composition on the phase diagram. The label(s) of the phase field where this point lies indicate the phase(s) that exist at equilibrium. If the point falls within a single-phase region, only that phase is present. If it falls within a two-phase region, then both phases indicated in that region coexist.
    
- **Compositions of Phases:**
    
    - **Single-Phase Region:** If only one phase is present, its composition is simply the same as the overall composition of the alloy.
        
    - **Two-Phase Region:** To find the composition of each phase, you need to use a **tie line** (also called an isotherm), which is a horizontal line drawn across the two-phase region at the temperature of interest. The composition of each phase is found at the intersection of the tie line with the phase boundary on either side. You then draw a vertical line from these intersection points down to the composition axis to read off the weight percentages of the components in each phase.
        
- **Percentages or Fractions of Phases:**
    
    - **Single-Phase Region:** If only one phase exists, its fraction is 1.0 or its percentage is 100%.
        
    - **Two-Phase Region:** The **lever rule** (or inverse lever rule) is used to calculate the relative amounts of each phase.
        
        1. A tie line is drawn across the two-phase region at the alloy's temperature.
            
        2. The overall alloy composition is located on this tie line.
            
        3. The mass fraction of one phase is calculated by taking the length of the tie line from the overall composition to the phase boundary of the _other_ phase and dividing it by the total length of the tie line.
            
        4. The mass fraction of the second phase is calculated similarly.
            
        5. To get percentages, multiply the mass fractions by 100.



### Mechanical properties of isomorphous alloys
This passage briefly explains how the **composition** of solid isomorphous alloys affects their **mechanical properties**, specifically tensile strength and ductility, when other factors like grain size are constant. Here's a summary:

- For solid isomorphous alloys (where the two components are completely soluble in the solid state) below the melting point of the weaker component, only a single solid phase is present.
    
- Adding one component to the other results in **solid-solution strengthening**. This means that the **strength** and **hardness** of the alloy increase as you add more of the second element.
    
- **Tensile strength** versus composition (as shown in Figure 9.6a, which is not visible) typically shows an increase with the addition of the second component, reaching a **maximum** at some intermediate composition.
    
- **Ductility** (%EL), on the other hand, exhibits the opposite behavior (as shown in Figure 9.6b, also not visible). The **ductility decreases** as more of the second component is added, and the curve usually shows a **minimum** at an intermediate composition.
    

In simpler terms, as you make the alloy stronger by mixing the two elements, it tends to become less flexible and more brittle. This is a common trade-off between strength and ductility in materials.


## Binary Eutectic System
![[Pasted image 20250317102434.png]]
3 phases. alpha beta liquid.
6 phase regions

Eutectic means to easily melt.




## Intermediate Phases

## Intermediate compounds

## Congruent Phase Transformation
Melting of pure materials: goes from solid to liquid
Allotropic Transformation: Composition doesn't change

Incongruent phase transformations (does change composition)
	Eutectic 
	Eutectoid
	Peritectic


## Ceramic Phase Diagrams

Are very similar to previous ones covered except they are no longer elements but compounds on the x axis
