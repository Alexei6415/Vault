# 6.2 Interpretation of Phase Diagrams

### Binary Isomorphous Systems
First and easiest thing to identify is number and types of phase present.
In Cu and Ni example: 
![[Pasted image 20250317100547.png]]

We have 2 phases :  Alpha and Liquid
We have 3 phase regions : Alpha region, Liquid region, Alpha and liquid region.


2nd thing to identify is the composition of the alloy (might not be the same as the phases.)

If in single phase region, the composition of the phase is the same as the entire alloy.

When not in single phase region, the composition of entire Alloy (Co) = where you are measuring from.

to get composition of the phases you draw a tie line.
![[Pasted image 20250317101108.png]]

Must hit both liquidus and Solidus line
Draw a line down to x axis and it gives the composition of the liquidus phase.
do the same for solidus phase.

Cl = 31,5 wt% Ni
Ca = 42.5 wt% Ni


Last parameter is Phase Amounts ( not the same as number of phases)
	refers to Mass fraction/Phase Fraction of alloy.

Solve by using Tie line again
Level Rule
	Wl = S(distance between opposite phase and its line from point) / (R + S)
	WL = S/ (R+S)
	Wa = R/R+S)
Wa + Wl = 1.


How to get the distance.
	take the composition and use those as lengths
	Wl = S/(R+S)-->
	Wl = (Ca - Co)/(Ca-Cl)
	Wa = R/(R+S) -->
	Wa = (Co - Cl)/(Ca-Cl)


Increase in temp means increase in Wl and decrease temp means increase in Wa.

Rather use Volume fraction ( is exact same basically) just useful cause we can estimate.


This passage explains how to interpret a binary phase diagram to obtain key information about a two-component system at equilibrium for a given temperature and overall composition. Three main types of information can be extracted:

- **Phases Present:** To determine which phases are present, you locate the point corresponding to the alloy's temperature and composition on the phase diagram. The label(s) of the phase field where this point lies indicate the phase(s) that exist at equilibrium. If the point falls within a single-phase region, only that phase is present. If it falls within a two-phase region, then both phases indicated in that region coexist.
    
- **Compositions of Phases:**
    
    - **Single-Phase Region:** If only one phase is present, its composition is simply the same as the overall composition of the alloy.
        
    - **Two-Phase Region:** To find the composition of each phase, you need to use a **tie line** (also called an isotherm), which is a horizontal line drawn across the two-phase region at the temperature of interest. The composition of each phase is found at the intersection of the tie line with the phase boundary on either side. You then draw a vertical line from these intersection points down to the composition axis to read off the weight percentages of the components in each phase.
        
- **Percentages or Fractions of Phases:**
    
    - **Single-Phase Region:** If only one phase exists, its fraction is 1.0 or its percentage is 100%.
        
    - **Two-Phase Region:** The **lever rule** (or inverse lever rule) is used to calculate the relative amounts of each phase.
        
        1. A tie line is drawn across the two-phase region at the alloy's temperature.
            
        2. The overall alloy composition is located on this tie line.
            
        3. The mass fraction of one phase is calculated by taking the length of the tie line from the overall composition to the phase boundary of the _other_ phase and dividing it by the total length of the tie line.
            
        4. The mass fraction of the second phase is calculated similarly.
            
        5. To get percentages, multiply the mass fractions by 100.



### Mechanical properties of isomorphous alloys
This passage briefly explains how the **composition** of solid isomorphous alloys affects their **mechanical properties**, specifically tensile strength and ductility, when other factors like grain size are constant. Here's a summary:

- For solid isomorphous alloys (where the two components are completely soluble in the solid state) below the melting point of the weaker component, only a single solid phase is present.
    
- Adding one component to the other results in **solid-solution strengthening**. This means that the **strength** and **hardness** of the alloy increase as you add more of the second element.
    
- **Tensile strength** versus composition (as shown in Figure 9.6a, which is not visible) typically shows an increase with the addition of the second component, reaching a **maximum** at some intermediate composition.
    
- **Ductility** (%EL), on the other hand, exhibits the opposite behavior (as shown in Figure 9.6b, also not visible). The **ductility decreases** as more of the second component is added, and the curve usually shows a **minimum** at an intermediate composition.
    

In simpler terms, as you make the alloy stronger by mixing the two elements, it tends to become less flexible and more brittle. This is a common trade-off between strength and ductility in materials.


## Binary Eutectic System
![[Pasted image 20250317102434.png]]
3 phases. alpha beta liquid.
6 phase regions

Eutectic means to easily melt.

This passage introduces another important type of binary phase diagram: the **binary eutectic phase diagram**, using the **copper–silver (Cu-Ag) system** as the primary example and briefly mentioning the **lead–tin (Pb-Sn) system**. Here's a summary of the key features:

- **Limited Solid Solubility:** Unlike isomorphous systems with complete solubility, eutectic systems exhibit **limited solid solubility**. This means that only a certain maximum amount of one component can dissolve in the other in the solid state.
    
- **Single-Phase Regions:** The Cu-Ag phase diagram (Figure 9.7) shows three single-phase regions:
    
    - **α (Alpha):** A solid solution that is rich in copper and has silver as the solute. It has an FCC crystal structure. Pure copper also exists as the α phase. The solubility of silver in copper is limited, shown by the solvus line CBA.
        
    - **β (Beta):** A solid solution that is rich in silver and has copper as the solute. It also has an FCC crystal structure. Pure silver also exists as the β phase. The solubility of copper in silver is limited, shown by the solvus line HG.
        
    - **L (Liquid):** A liquid solution of copper and silver.
        
- **Solvus Lines:** Lines CBA and HG indicate the solubility limits of silver in copper (α phase) and copper in silver (β phase) as a function of temperature. Below 779°C, these are called solvus lines.
    
- **Solidus Lines:** AB and GF are solidus lines indicating the temperature below which the alloy is completely solid. The horizontal line BEG is also considered a solidus line, representing the lowest temperature at which a liquid phase can exist at equilibrium for any Cu-Ag alloy.
    
- **Liquidus Lines:** AE and FE are liquidus lines indicating the temperatures above which the alloy is completely liquid.
    
- **Two-Phase Regions:** The diagram also shows three two-phase regions: α + L, β + L, and α + β, where the respective phases coexist in equilibrium. Tie lines and the lever rule can be used to determine the compositions and amounts of the phases in these regions, as previously described.
    
- **Eutectic Point (E):** The liquidus lines AE and FE intersect at a specific composition (CE = 71.9 wt% Ag) and temperature (TE = 779°C) known as the **eutectic point**.
    
- **Eutectic Reaction:** At the eutectic temperature, a very important **invariant reaction** occurs for an alloy with the eutectic composition upon cooling:
    
    ```
    L (eutectic composition)  ⇌  α (copper-rich solid solution) + β (silver-rich solid solution)
    ```
    
    For the Cu-Ag system, this is:
    
    ```
    L(71.9 wt% Ag) ⇌ α(8.0 wt% Ag) + β(91.2 wt% Ag)
    ```
    
    Upon heating, the reverse reaction occurs. The term "eutectic" means "easily melted".
    
- **Eutectic Isotherm:** The horizontal line BEG at the eutectic temperature (TE) is also called the eutectic isotherm.
    
- **Solid Product:** The eutectic reaction results in the simultaneous formation of two solid phases from a liquid phase at a constant temperature.
    
- **Lead-Tin System:** The lead-tin (Pb-Sn) system (Figure 9.8) is another common eutectic system with a similar shape to the Cu-Ag diagram. Its eutectic point is at 61.9 wt% Sn and 183°C.
    
- **General Rules for Binary Phase Diagrams:**
    
    - Within a phase field, at equilibrium, there can be at most one or two phases.
        
    - In a eutectic system, three phases (α, β, and L) can be in equilibrium only along the eutectic isotherm.
        
    - Single-phase regions are always separated by a two-phase region consisting of the two single phases they separate.


## Intermediate Phases
![[Pasted image 20250317103450.png]]
This passage describes the development of microstructures during the slow cooling of binary eutectic alloys, using the lead–tin (Pb–Sn) system as an example, focusing on four different composition ranges:

**Case 1: Compositions between a pure component and the maximum solid solubility at room temperature (e.g., 0-2 wt% Sn or 99-100 wt% Sn in Pb-Sn).**

- As the liquid alloy cools and reaches the liquidus line, a single solid phase starts to form (either the α phase, which is lead-rich, or the β phase, which is tin-rich).
    
- Solidification continues until the solidus line is crossed.
    
- The final microstructure is a polycrystalline solid with a uniform composition of either α or β phase.
    

**Case 2: Compositions between the room temperature solubility limit and the maximum solid solubility at the eutectic temperature (e.g., 2-18.3 wt% Sn or 97.8-99 wt% Sn in Pb-Sn).**

- Initially, a single solid phase (α or β) forms from the liquid as in Case 1.
    
- Upon further cooling and crossing the **solvus line**, the solubility limit within the solid phase is exceeded.
    
- This causes the formation of small particles of the **second solid phase** (β precipitates in α, or α precipitates in β). These particles grow as cooling continues.
    

**Case 3: Eutectic Composition (61.9 wt% Sn in Pb-Sn).**

- The liquid alloy cools without any phase change until it reaches the **eutectic temperature** (183°C for Pb-Sn).
    
- At the eutectic temperature, the liquid transforms directly into a characteristic **eutectic structure**.
    
- This structure consists of alternating layers (lamellae) of the α phase (lead-rich) and the β phase (tin-rich) that form simultaneously.
    

**Case 4: Compositions other than the eutectic that cross the eutectic isotherm (e.g., 40 wt% Sn in Pb-Sn).**

- As the liquid alloy cools, it first enters a two-phase region (α + L in this example). A primary solid phase (primary α in this case) starts to form.
    
- Cooling continues until the alloy reaches the **eutectic temperature**. At this point, the remaining liquid, which has now reached the eutectic composition, undergoes the eutectic reaction.
    
- This results in a microstructure containing **grains of the primary α phase** surrounded by the **eutectic structure** (lamellae of α and β phases).
    

The passage also introduces the term **microconstituent**, which is a distinct element of the microstructure with a characteristic structure. In the context of eutectic alloys, both the primary α (or β) and the eutectic structure itself are considered microconstituents. The relative amounts of these microconstituents can be calculated using the lever rule, considering the overall alloy composition and the compositions at the ends of the tie line at the eutectic temperature.

Finally, the passage mentions that if equilibrium conditions are not maintained during cooling through the α (or β) + liquid region, the primary microconstituents can exhibit **coring** (non-uniform composition), and the fraction of the eutectic microconstituent might be greater than predicted by equilibrium conditions.
## Intermediate compounds 
![[Pasted image 20250317103540.png]]
This passage introduces the concept that many binary alloy systems have phase diagrams that are more complex than the simple isomorphous and eutectic types discussed so far. Here's a summary:

- **Beyond Simple Systems:** While isomorphous and simple eutectic diagrams are fundamental, many binary alloy systems exhibit more intricate phase behavior.
    
- **Terminal Solid Solutions:** In eutectic systems like copper-silver and lead-tin, the solid solution phases (α and β) that exist near the composition extremes of the diagram are called **terminal solid solutions**.
    
- **Intermediate Solid Solutions (or Intermediate Phases):** Some binary systems also feature **intermediate solid solutions** or **intermediate phases** that appear at compositions between the extremes of the phase diagram.
    
- **Example: Copper-Zinc (Brass) System:** The copper-zinc phase diagram (Figure 9.19) is given as an example of a more complex system. It has two terminal solid solutions (α and η) and four intermediate solid solutions (β, γ, δ, and ε). The β' phase is an **ordered solid solution** where the copper and zinc atoms have a specific, ordered arrangement within the crystal structure. Some phase boundaries at low temperatures are uncertain (dashed lines) due to slow diffusion rates hindering the attainment of equilibrium. The fundamental rules for interpreting phase compositions and amounts still apply.
    
- **Intermediate Compounds (Intermetallic Compounds):** In some systems, instead of intermediate solid solutions, discrete **intermediate compounds** with specific chemical formulas can form. These are often called **intermetallic compounds** in metal-metal systems.
    
- **Example: Magnesium-Lead System:** The magnesium-lead (Mg-Pb) system (Figure 9.20) features the intermetallic compound Mg₂Pb. This compound exists only at a specific composition (19 wt% Mg - 81 wt% Pb) and is represented as a vertical line on the phase diagram. Mg₂Pb melts at a specific temperature and can be considered a component itself. The Mg-Pb system also shows significant solubility of lead in magnesium (α phase) but very limited solubility of magnesium in lead (β phase). Complex phase diagrams can sometimes be simplified by considering them as combinations of simpler eutectic diagrams involving the intermediate compounds as components.

### Eutectoid and Peritectic Reactions
![[Pasted image 20250504112937.png]]
This passage describes two additional **invariant reactions** that can occur in binary alloy systems besides the eutectic reaction: the **eutectoid reaction** and the **peritectic reaction**. Here's a summary of each:

**Eutectoid Reaction:**

- **Definition:** A **solid phase** transforms upon cooling into **two different solid phases**. The reverse occurs upon heating. It's often described as "eutectic-like" but happens entirely in the solid state.
    
- **Example (Copper-Zinc System):** At 560°C (the **eutectoid isotherm**) and 74 wt% Zn (the **eutectoid composition**), the solid **δ phase** in the copper-zinc system transforms into two other solid phases, **γ** and **ε**, upon cooling:
    
    ```
    δ  ⇌  γ + ε
    cooling
    heating
    ```
    
- **Eutectoid Point:** The point on the phase diagram corresponding to the eutectoid reaction is labelled **E** in Figure 9.21.
    
- **Key Difference from Eutectic:** The key difference is that a solid transforms into two solids in a eutectoid reaction, whereas a liquid transforms into two solids in a eutectic reaction.
    
- **Importance:** The eutectoid reaction in the iron-carbon system is very important for the heat treatment of steels.
    

**Peritectic Reaction:**

- **Definition:** Upon **heating**, one **solid phase** transforms into a **liquid phase** and **another solid phase**. The reverse occurs upon cooling.
    
- **Example (Copper-Zinc System):** In the copper-zinc system at 598°C (1108°F) and 78.6 wt% Zn (point P in Figure 9.21), the **δ phase** reacts with the **liquid (L)** phase upon heating to form the **ε phase**:
    
    ```
    δ + L  ⇌  ε
    cooling
    heating
    ```
    
- **Low-Temperature Solid Phase:** The solid phase that transforms can be either an intermediate solid solution (like ε in the example) or a terminal solid solution (existing at the ends of the phase diagram). The passage mentions another peritectic in the Cu-Zn system at around 97 wt% Zn and 435°C where the terminal η phase transforms into ε and liquid upon heating.
    
- **Other Peritectic in Cu-Zn:** The passage also notes that there are three other peritectic reactions in the copper-zinc system involving the intermediate solid solutions β, δ, and γ as the low-temperature phases that transform upon heating.

## Congruent Phase Transformation
Melting of pure materials: goes from solid to liquid
Allotropic Transformation: Composition doesn't change

Incongruent phase transformations (does change composition)
	Eutectic 
	Eutectoid
	Peritectic

This passage classifies **phase transformations** based on whether the **compositions** of the phases involved change during the transformation:

- **Congruent Transformations:** These are transformations where the **composition of all the phases remains unchanged**. Examples given are:
    
    - **Allotropic transformations:** Where a pure element changes its crystal structure (mentioned in Section 3.6, which we covered earlier).
        
    - **Melting of pure materials:** When a pure substance goes from solid to liquid, its composition remains the same.
        
- **Incongruent Transformations:** These are transformations where **at least one of the phases experiences a change in composition**. Examples given are:
    
    - **Eutectic and eutectoid reactions:** In these, a liquid transforms into two solids (eutectic) or a solid transforms into two other solids (eutectoid), and the compositions of the resulting phases are different from the starting phase.
        
    - **Melting of an alloy in an isomorphous system:** When an alloy like copper-nickel melts, the compositions of the solid and liquid phases that coexist over a temperature range are generally different from each other and from the overall alloy composition (as we saw earlier).
        
    - **Peritectic reaction:** Here, one solid phase transforms into a liquid phase and another solid phase, all with different compositions.
        

The passage also notes that **intermediate phases** (phases that occur at compositions between the pure components) can be classified based on how they melt:

- Some intermediate phases, like the intermetallic compound Mg₂Pb in the magnesium-lead system, **melt congruently**. This means they melt directly into a liquid that has the **same composition** as the solid phase.
    
- In some systems, like nickel-titanium, a solid solution (γ in this case) can have a **congruent melting point** where the liquidus and solidus lines are tangent, indicating that the solid melts into a liquid of the same composition at that specific point.
    
- The **peritectic reaction** is given as an example of **incongruent melting** for an intermediate phase because the solid phase transforms into a liquid and another solid phase, both with different compositions.





## Ceramic Phase Diagrams

Are very similar to previous ones covered except they are no longer elements but compounds on the x axis
![[Pasted image 20250405173530.png]]
Ceramic phase diagrams are incredible useful in the design and manufacture of ceramics. 

Phase diagrams have also been determined for metallic( as well as ceramic) systems containing more then two components; however, their representation and interpretation is super complex. A ternary composition-Temperature diagram in its entirety is depicted in 3D, so portrayal in 2D is not possible.
