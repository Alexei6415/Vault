# 6.2 Interpretation of Phase Diagrams

### Binary Isomorphous Systems
First and easiest thing to identify is number and types of phase present.
In Cu and Ni example: 
![[Pasted image 20250317100547.png]]

We have 2 phases :  Alpha and Liquid
We have 3 phase regions : Alpha region, Liquid region, Alpha and liquid region.


2nd thing to identify is the composition of the alloy (might not be the same as the phases.)

If in single phase region, the composition of the phase is the same as the entire alloy.

When not in single phase region, the composition of entire Alloy (Co) = where you are measuring from.

to get composition of the phases you draw a tie line.

Must hit both liquidus and Solidus line
Draw a line down to x axis and it gives the composition of the liquidus phase.
do the same for solidus phase.

Cl = 31,5 wt% Ni
Ca = 42.5 wt% Ni


Last parameter is Phase Amounts ( not the same as number of phases)
	refers to Mass fraction/Phase Fraction of alloy.

Solve by using Tie line again
Level Rule
	Wl = S(distance between opposite phase and its line from point) / (R + S)
	WL = S/ (R+S)
	Wa = R/R+S)
Wa + Wl = 1.


How to get the distance.
	take the composition and use those as lengths
	Wl = S/(R+S)-->
	Wl = (Ca - Co)/(Ca-Cl)
	Wa = R/(R+S) -->
	Wa = (Co - Cl)/(Ca-Cl)


Increase in temp means increase in Wl and decrease temp means increase in Wa.

Rather use Volume fraction ( is exact same basically) just useful cause we can estimate.


## Binary Eutectic System
![[Pasted image 20250317102434.png]]
3 phases. alpha beta liquid.
6 phase regions

Eutectic means to easily melt.

## Intermediate Phases

## Intermediate compounds

## Congruent Phase Transformation
Melting of pure materials: goes from solid to liquid
Allotropic Transformation: Composition doesn't change

Incongruent phase transformations (does change composition)
	Eutectic 
	Eutectoid
	Peritectic


## Ceramic Phase Diagrams

Are very similar to previous ones covered except they are no longer elements but compounds on the x axis
