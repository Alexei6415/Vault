![[Pasted image 20250307101429.png]]


#### General Practical instructions
During the course of the semester, each student will be required to participate in three practical sessions. The format for each of these practical weeks will be as follows:

- You will be expected to prepare for each practical by going through and studying the practical resources within this lesson.
- You will then need to complete the **Preparation Quiz** for the practical.
    - You will only get access to the Preparation Quiz by working through this entire lesson until the "End of Lesson" page (last page)
    - This Preparation Quiz will be open from **9 am on the Friday 7 March to 7 pm on the Friday 14 March.** See the Module Framework for exact dates for each Practical session.
    - You can take the Preparation Quiz as many times as you want, and it does not count towards your practical grade, but you do require a **minimum mark of >= 70%** for the Preparation Quiz to **gain access to the Practical Test**.
- The **Practical Test** counts towards your Assessment Further (Semester) Mark as outlined in the Module Framework
    - The Practical Test will open from 7 **am to 7 pm on Friday 14 March**. **Therefore, the Practical Test is only open for _that_ day.** 
    - Only 1 attempt is allowed.
    - Learning assistants are only available on the Practical Chat from 9 am to 5 pm on the Friday of the Practical Test. The chat provides faster feedback than forums. 
- Follow instructions carefully. 
- Enjoy!

### Excel Basics

The use of spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel (from hereon referred to as MS Excel) is actually more common amongst engineering applications than one might expect (see an [asteroid exploration application here](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/lockheed-martin-nasa-spacecraft-lucy-heads-to-jupiter-asteroids-with-help-from-excel.html)). For instance, our Materials Engineering Research Group postgraduates normally use MS Excel to initially process and plot their raw data that they have obtained from the tensile testing machines. As engineers in practice, you might be in a situation where you either perform a test or receive raw data from a laboratory technician who performed a test and you then have to process and analyse the raw data. Practical 1 is where we will practise this for a uniaxial tensile test applied to a metal alloy.

**Overview**

The dataset from the tensile test is made available in a format that can be opened and read in Notepad. This must be imported into MS Excel from which further calculations need to be made. The columns of importance are those from the load cell and extensometer. The basics of data importing, and graph plotting will be covered. Note: this guide refers to Microsoft 365’s version of MS Excel. This version is currently installed on the FIRGA/FECUA computer user area computers. For other versions and/or further information, please refer to [Microsoft Excel’s support page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/excel).

**Set decimal separator to point**

Often the text file that contains the data contains data values that are decimal separated with a point (for example: 0.1). However, the standard South African format for the decimal separator is the comma (for example: 0,1) and is the separator method that MS Excel uses by default. Different decimal separators between MS Excel and the data in the text file prevents one from manipulating and extracting data within MS Excel. One can change their system settings to use a decimal point instead of a decimal comma or one can change the setting in MS Excel as follows:

- Go to File -> Options -> Advanced.
- Near the bottom of the Editing options section uncheck “Use system separators”.
- Replace the comma (,) with a point (.) for the Decimal separator.
- Close and reopen MS Excel.

**Importing data**

- In MS Excel, click the Data ribbon at the top of the screen.
- In the Get & Transform Data block, select From Text/CSV and then search for the file on your computer containing the data downloaded from SUNLearn.
- At the top, ensure the delimiter is set to Tab.
- Select Transform data.
- In the Home ribbon, in the transform section, click “use first row as headers”.
- Near the top left of screen, select “Close and Load”.
- Identify the columns of importance (there should be headers in the data, but if not, you should still know how to identify the measurement made by the load cell and extensometer).
- You can delete the other channels - only keep the two that you require.

**Graph plotting**

Assuming that you have already manipulated the data correctly i.e. the measured load has been converted to stress and the extensometer readings, along with its gauge length, have been used to calculate strain, you can now proceed with the following steps.

- Select the Insert ribbon at the top of the screen.
- In the Charts block, select Scatter plot.
- Right-click the chart area that has come up and select Select Data.
- Click Add, and highlight the correct data for the Series X values and Series Y values respectively.

### Tensile Data Processing Walkthrough

- The **correct type of graph type to select** when plotting your stress-strain curve depends on the following:
    - If you are plotting individual measurement points, these should be plotted as discrete points on your graph (e.g. strain calculated from extensometer measurements)
    - If you are plotting a general equation for the relationship between two variables, you should plot this as a continuous line as the function is valid for all values in the domain (e.g. stress calculated as a function (σ = E*(ε-0.002)) of the 0.2% offset strain to plot the 0.2% yield strength construction line)
- The elongation raw data is obtained from the **extensometer** so the strain column should use the distance between the extensometer arms (20 mm in the case of the demo data set) as the original measurement length for these strain values. 
- The **gauge length** is equal to **5 x the original diameter** for round specimens (as per ASTM E8M) and is a physical length present on the specimen geometry itself.  Within the gauge region of the specimen, various marks can be made (as shown in the videos in the Practical 1 resource) to measure the _elongation after fracture_. 
- In addition to fitting a line, you can also use two suitably selected points (spaced out across the middle of the linear elastic region) to **calculate the Young's (elastic) modulus**. Be sure to avoid choosing points near the noisy start of the region and/or near the region with the plastic deformation at the end of this linear elastic region.
- You can calculate **resilience** using either an incremental area sum method (eg. trapezoidal method/Riemann sum described in the video) or you can use equation 6.13b (10e Callister) or 8.13b (9e Callister). Note however the warning included in the video about using the Riemann sum method when you have noisy (not monotonic) data. 
- You can calculate **toughness** using either an incremental area sum method (eg. trapezoidal method/Riemann sum described in the video) or by dividing the area under the curve into smaller, easier to manage shapes (eg. triangle, trapezoids, rectangles, etc.) and then calculating the total area as the sum of the areas of these shapes. 

- The **definition of toughness** stands as follows in the back of Callister (10e SI version, page G-12):

_A mechanical characteristic that may be expressed in three contexts:_

1. _the measure of a material's resistance to fracture when a crack (or other stress-concentrating defect) is present **(NOTE: we will get to this property next term in Ch 8)**_
2. _the ability of a material to absorb energy and plastically deform before fracturing; and_
3. _the total area under the material's tensile engineering stress-strain curve taken to fracture **(NOTE: this is the calculation we must do in Practical 1. The key words here are "to fracture". This is why we take the full area under curve and NOT the area that involves elastic recovery occurring after fracture - demonstrative sketch below).**_

#### AI HELP BOT
They have developed a tutor bot to help with Tensile Strength and getting that information off of a graph, do not need to use but will be useful.


Things to know with the AI
- Can get things wrong
- always double check the work as output can be wrong
Things to try
- Be curious, ask a lot of questions and ask for more feedback.
- Prompts for real world examples to help understand



## How to draw a stress strain curve
1. Read the information
2. Identify the load data and elongation data
3. Stress Calculation: Calculate stress using the formula:
	σ=FA\sigma = \frac{F}{A}
	where σ\sigma is the stress, FF is the force, and AA is the original cross-sectional area of the specimen.

4. Strain Calculation: Calculate strain using the formula:
    
	ϵ=ΔLL0\epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0}

	where ϵ\epsilon is the strain, ΔL\Delta L is the change in length, and L0L_0 is the original gauge length of the specimen.

5. Plotting the Curve: Plot the stress on the Y-axis and the strain on the X-axis. The resulting graph is your stress-strain curve.
    

The curve will generally have distinct regions:

- **Elastic Region**: Where the material returns to its original shape when the load is removed.
    
- **Yield Point**: The point at which permanent deformation begins.
    
- **Plastic Region**: Where the material undergoes permanent deformation.
    
- **Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS)**: The maximum stress the material can withstand.
    
- **Fracture Point**: Where the material ultimately fails and breaks.
