#### General Practical instructions
During the course of the semester, each student will be required to participate in three practical sessions. The format for each of these practical weeks will be as follows:

- You will be expected to prepare for each practical by going through and studying the practical resources within this lesson.
- You will then need to complete the **Preparation Quiz** for the practical.
    - You will only get access to the Preparation Quiz by working through this entire lesson until the "End of Lesson" page (last page)
    - This Preparation Quiz will be open from **9 am on the Friday 7 March to 7 pm on the Friday 14 March.** See the Module Framework for exact dates for each Practical session.
    - You can take the Preparation Quiz as many times as you want, and it does not count towards your practical grade, but you do require a **minimum mark of >= 70%** for the Preparation Quiz to **gain access to the Practical Test**.
- The **Practical Test** counts towards your Assessment Further (Semester) Mark as outlined in the Module Framework
    - The Practical Test will open from 7 **am to 7 pm on Friday 14 March**. **Therefore, the Practical Test is only open for _that_ day.** 
    - Only 1 attempt is allowed.
    - Learning assistants are only available on the Practical Chat from 9 am to 5 pm on the Friday of the Practical Test. The chat provides faster feedback than forums. 
- Follow instructions carefully.

### Excel Basics

The use of spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel (from hereon referred to as MS Excel) is actually more common amongst engineering applications than one might expect (see an [asteroid exploration application here](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/lockheed-martin-nasa-spacecraft-lucy-heads-to-jupiter-asteroids-with-help-from-excel.html)). For instance, our Materials Engineering Research Group postgraduates normally use MS Excel to initially process and plot their raw data that they have obtained from the tensile testing machines. As engineers in practice, you might be in a situation where you either perform a test or receive raw data from a laboratory technician who performed a test and you then have to process and analyse the raw data. Practical 1 is where we will practise this for a uniaxial tensile test applied to a metal alloy.

**Overview**

The dataset from the tensile test is made available in a format that can be opened and read in Notepad. This must be imported into MS Excel from which further calculations need to be made. The columns of importance are those from the load cell and extensometer. The basics of data importing, and graph plotting will be covered. Note: this guide refers to Microsoft 365’s version of MS Excel. This version is currently installed on the FIRGA/FECUA computer user area computers. For other versions and/or further information, please refer to [Microsoft Excel’s support page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/excel).

**Set decimal separator to point**

Often the text file that contains the data contains data values that are decimal separated with a point (for example: 0.1). However, the standard South African format for the decimal separator is the comma (for example: 0,1) and is the separator method that MS Excel uses by default. Different decimal separators between MS Excel and the data in the text file prevents one from manipulating and extracting data within MS Excel. One can change their system settings to use a decimal point instead of a decimal comma or one can change the setting in MS Excel as follows:

- Go to File -> Options -> Advanced.
- Near the bottom of the Editing options section uncheck “Use system separators”.
- Replace the comma (,) with a point (.) for the Decimal separator.
- Close and reopen MS Excel.

**Importing data**

- In MS Excel, click the Data ribbon at the top of the screen.
- In the Get & Transform Data block, select From Text/CSV and then search for the file on your computer containing the data downloaded from SUNLearn.
- At the top, ensure the delimiter is set to Tab.
- Select Transform data.
- In the Home ribbon, in the transform section, click “use first row as headers”.
- Near the top left of screen, select “Close and Load”.
- Identify the columns of importance (there should be headers in the data, but if not, you should still know how to identify the measurement made by the load cell and extensometer).
- You can delete the other channels - only keep the two that you require.

**Graph plotting**

Assuming that you have already manipulated the data correctly i.e. the measured load has been converted to stress and the extensometer readings, along with its gauge length, have been used to calculate strain, you can now proceed with the following steps.

- Select the Insert ribbon at the top of the screen.
- In the Charts block, select Scatter plot.
- Right-click the chart area that has come up and select Select Data.
- Click Add, and highlight the correct data for the Series X values and Series Y values respectively.

### Tensile Data Processing Walkthrough

- The **correct type of graph type to select** when plotting your stress-strain curve depends on the following:
    - If you are plotting individual measurement points, these should be plotted as discrete points on your graph (e.g. strain calculated from extensometer measurements)
    - If you are plotting a general equation for the relationship between two variables, you should plot this as a continuous line as the function is valid for all values in the domain (e.g. stress calculated as a function (σ = E*(ε-0.002)) of the 0.2% offset strain to plot the 0.2% yield strength construction line)
- The elongation raw data is obtained from the **extensometer** so the strain column should use the distance between the extensometer arms (20 mm in the case of the demo data set) as the original measurement length for these strain values. 
- The **gauge length** is equal to **5 x the original diameter** for round specimens (as per ASTM E8M) and is a physical length present on the specimen geometry itself.  Within the gauge region of the specimen, various marks can be made (as shown in the videos in the Practical 1 resource) to measure the _elongation after fracture_. 
- In addition to fitting a line, you can also use two suitably selected points (spaced out across the middle of the linear elastic region) to **calculate the Young's (elastic) modulus**. Be sure to avoid choosing points near the noisy start of the region and/or near the region with the plastic deformation at the end of this linear elastic region.
- You can calculate **resilience** using either an incremental area sum method (eg. trapezoidal method/Riemann sum described in the video) or you can use equation 6.13b (10e Callister) or 8.13b (9e Callister). Note however the warning included in the video about using the Riemann sum method when you have noisy (not monotonic) data. 
- You can calculate **toughness** using either an incremental area sum method (eg. trapezoidal method/Riemann sum described in the video) or by dividing the area under the curve into smaller, easier to manage shapes (eg. triangle, trapezoids, rectangles, etc.) and then calculating the total area as the sum of the areas of these shapes. 

- The **definition of toughness** stands as follows in the back of Callister (10e SI version, page G-12):

_A mechanical characteristic that may be expressed in three contexts:_

1. _the measure of a material's resistance to fracture when a crack (or other stress-concentrating defect) is present **(NOTE: we will get to this property next term in Ch 8)**_
2. _the ability of a material to absorb energy and plastically deform before fracturing; and_
3. _the total area under the material's tensile engineering stress-strain curve taken to fracture **(NOTE: this is the calculation we must do in Practical 1. The key words here are "to fracture". This is why we take the full area under curve and NOT the area that involves elastic recovery occurring after fracture - demonstrative sketch below).**_

- **How to draw a 0.2% offset line in MS Excel for a stress-strain curve (By Prof Blaine in a previous class session in 2023)**
    - Also contains additional information on:
        - elongation AT and AFTER fracture
        - calculation of area under the stress strain curve in MS Excel for calculating resilience and/or toughness










#### AI HELP BOT
They have developed a tutor bot to help with Tensile Strength and getting that information off of a graph, do not need to use but will be useful.


Things to know with the AI
- Can get things wrong
- always double check the work as output can be wrong
Things to try
- Be curious, ask a lot of questions and ask for more feedback.
- Prompts for real world examples to help understand



## How to draw a stress strain curve
1. Read the information
2. Identify the load data and elongation data
3. Stress Calculation: Calculate stress using the formula:
	$\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$
	where σ\sigma is the stress, FF is the force, and AA is the original cross-sectional area of the specimen.

4. Strain Calculation: Calculate strain using the formula:
    
	ϵ=ΔLL0\epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0}

	where ϵ\epsilon is the strain, ΔL\Delta L is the change in length, and L0L_0 is the original gauge length of the specimen.

5. Plotting the Curve: Plot the stress on the Y-axis and the strain on the X-axis. The resulting graph is your stress-strain curve.
    

The curve will generally have distinct regions:

- **Elastic Region**: Where the material returns to its original shape when the load is removed.
    
- **Yield Point**: The point at which permanent deformation begins.
    
- **Plastic Region**: Where the material undergoes permanent deformation.
    
- **Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS)**: The maximum stress the material can withstand.
    
- **Fracture Point**: Where the material ultimately fails and breaks.

### Multi topic intergration 
#### Multi-topic Integration Map

**Mapping the Integrated Topics of Practical 3**

You are nearing the end of the Materials Science A214 module. As we near the end of the semester, Practical 3 (covering impact tests + Jominy end-quench tests) is a good demonstration of the integrative nature of the content. As a result, Practical 3 will require you to revise several concepts - some (hardenability and impact tests) are more core to this Practical 3 whilst others (for example, CCT diagrams) are required to support your understanding. For example, we would not know that martensite forms at the quenched end of a Jominy specimen if we did not know that fast cooling rates prevent diffusion and so form this single, supersaturated phase according to continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams. 

The diagram below is a map of the main themes integrated within Practical 3. You do not need to memorise it but seeing how things are linked to one another could help you both in this Practical 3 and also in studying for the main assessments.

### Practical resources
**Textbook Sections and Video Lectures:**

- Work through Ch 6.10, Ch 8.6 & Ch 11.9 (Callister 10e) / Ch 8.5, Ch 10.6 & Ch 17.6 (Callister 9e).
- Revise the following content:
    - Week 4, Lecture 1 video (around 30 min 30 sec mark).
    - Week 11, Lecture 2 video (around 7 min to 13 min 30 sec).
    - Week 12, Lecture 1 video (around 17 min 50 sec to 22 min).
    - Note: you might have to also briefly revise Practical 2 content (reading micrographs) and basics of phase transformation (topics of Week 10). Although not the core focus of Practical 3, this content is greatly interlinked with Practical 3 (recall the integrative nature of Materials Science!)

**ASTM Standards:**

**Keep these open for reference while processing your data for the Preparation Quiz and final Practical Test Quiz. For the Practical Test:**

- You are required to know these standards well enough that you can perform an impact test and Jominy end-quench test according to the test standard.  
    
- You should know and understand all relevant terms presented in the standards.
- You should be able to evaluate, interpret and document the results of testing according to the test standards.

Impact Testing Standard (ASTM E23)[https://stemlearn.sun.ac.za/pluginfile.php/101437/mod_resource/content/2/E23-07.pdf]

- This is standard testing methodology for Charpy (and Izod) impact tests.
- Regarding the Annexes:
    - Annexes A5 and A6 (pages 21 - 24) are important but the rest of the Annexes are for additional information only. 

Hardenability of Steels Standard (ASTM A255)[https://stemlearn.sun.ac.za/pluginfile.php/101438/mod_resource/content/2/A255-02.pdf]

- This is the prescribed test standard for hardenability tests of steels.
- Section 10 and the Appendix (pages 5-6 & 23-24) is for additional information only.
- Tables 1, 7 and 12 are important. We do not use the rest of the Tables in this Practical.

**Impact Testing Demonstration Videos:** 

**Watch these to make your life easier!**

- Video instructions of how to prepare for and perform an impact test (specifically Charpy impact test) using equipment available in our own laboratories.
- Watch in the order of Video 1, Video 2, Video 3 and Video 4.
- Pay attention to detail.


**Jominy End-Quench Test Demonstration Videos:** 

**Watch these to make your life easier!**

- Video instructions of how to prepare for and perform a hardenability test on steels (specifically the Jominy end-quench test) using equipment available in our own laboratories.
- Measuring hardenability requires some knowledge of hardness testing (specifically Rockwell hardness tests are used in Video 6)
- Watch in the order of Video 5 then Video 6.
- **NOTE: Video 5 shows that the flats for hardness measurement on the hardenability specimen is machined _before_ the quenching process. This is not standard practice (see the ASTM A255 standard). Typically the unmachined specimen is first heat treated, quenched and then the flats are machined for hardness measurement.**


## Examples of hardenability curves

**Examples of Hardenability Curve Plots**

Below are examples of hardenability curves of a steel alloy plotted using MS Excel. Smoothed connective lines have been added between data points to clearly show the shape and trend of the curves. Two different curves (theoretical and experimental) are shown for two different unit systems used for the distance from the quenched end (metric and imperial). Tip: 1 inch is equal to 25.4 mm. The theoretical curve was calculated using composition (Section 10 in ASTM A255 - you do NOT have to know how to do this). The experimental curve is taken from an actual hardenability test. Note that the experimental data is only plotted up to >=20 HRC (Why? See Section 6.4).
